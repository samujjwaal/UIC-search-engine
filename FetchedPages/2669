<p>
The classic machine learning paradigm learns in isolation. 
Given a dataset, a learning algorithm is applied to a dataset to produce 
a model without considering any previously learned knowledge. 
This paradigm needs a large number of training examples and is 
only suitable for well-defined and narrow tasks in closed environments. 
Looking ahead, to deal with these limitations and to learn more like 
humans, I believe that it is necessary to do <b><i>lifelong machine 
learning</i></b> or simply <b><i>lifelong learning</i></b> 
(also called <b><i>continual learning</i></b> or even <b><i>continuous 
learning</i></b>), which tries to mimic "human learning" to build 
a <i>lifelong learning machine</i>. The key characteristic of 
"human learning" is the <i>continual learning and adaptation to 
new environments</i> - we accumulate the knowledge 
gained in the past and use the knowledge to help future learning 
and problem solving with possible adaptations. Ideally, it should also be 
able to discover new tasks and learn on the job in open environments in
a self-supervised manner. Without the lifelong learning capability, 
AI systems will probably never be truly intelligent. 
learning machine or agent to <i>continually learn and 
accumulate knowledge</i>, and to become more and more 
knowledgeable and better and better at learning. 

<p> <b>Human learning is very different</b>: I believe that no human being has ever been given 1000 positive and 
1000 negative documents (or images) and asked to learn a text classifier. 
As we have accumulated so much knowledge in the past and understand it, 
we can usually learn with little effort and few examples. If we don't 
have the accumulated knowledge, even if we are given 2000 training 
examples, it is very hard to learn manually. For example, I don't 
understand Arabic. If you give me 2000 Arabic documents and ask me to 
build a classifier, I cannot do it. But that is exactly what current 
machine learning is doing. That is not how humans learn.

<h3>Our Work</h3>

Some of my work uses <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">sentiment analysis</a> (SA) tasks and data because it is the problems that I encountered in a SA startup that motivated me to work on lifelong learning or continual learning. SA is very hard to scale-up without lifelong learning.

are increasingly facing the real-world open and dynamic environments, where there are always new or unexpected objects. 
But traditional learning makes the close-world assumption: test instances must be from only the training/seen classes, which is not true in the open world. 
Ideally, an open-world learner should be able to do the following:
<ul>
<li> detecting instances of unseen classes - not seen in training (the <b>DOC algorithm</b> (<a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/emnlp17-camera-ready.pdf">EMNLP-2017</a>) is quite powerful for this task for both text and images), 
<li> autmatically identifying unseen classes from the detected instances in a <i>self-supervised</i> manner, and
<li> incrementally learning the new/unseen classes. 
</ul>
In this process, the system becomes more and more knowledgeable and better 
at learning. It also knows what it does and does not know.</i>

In this work, we aim to build a <i>lifelong and interactive</i> knowledge learning engine for chatbots.

<h3> Related Learning Paradigms: Transfer learning, multitask learning, and lifelong learning</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Characterisitcs of lifelong learning</b>: (1) learning continuously (ideally in the open world), (2) accumulating the previously learned knowledge to become more and more knowledgeable, (3) using the knowledge to learn more knowledge and adapting it for problem solving, (4) discovering new problems/tasks to be learned and learning them incrementally, and (5) learning on the job or learning while working, improving model during testing or model applications.  
<li> <b>Transfer learning vs. lifelong learning</b>: Transfer learning 
uses the source domain labeled data to help target domain learning. 
Unlike lifelong learning, transfer learning is not continual and has 
no knowledge retention (as it uses source labeled data, not learned 
knowledge). The source must be similar to the target (which 
are normally selected by the user). It is also only one-directional: 
source helps target, but not the other way around because the target has no
or little labeled data. 

<li><b>Multitask learning vs. lifelong learning</b>: Multitask learning 
jointly 
optimizes learning of multiple tasks. Although it is possible to make 
it continual, multitask learning does not retain any explicit knowledge 
except data, and when the number of task is really large, it is hard to 
re-learn everything when faced with a new task.
