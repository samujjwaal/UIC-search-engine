								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>We know this spring has been difficult for UIC students. We are sending a student survey to students&#8217; UIC email addresses to check in and see how you are doing, and to give you the opportunity to tell us what is working and what is not working. The results of this survey will help us evaluate our activities this semester as well as develop plans for the future.</p>



<p>Your participation in this survey is voluntary. There are no penalties if you decide not to participate or if you choose to skip any questions. The survey is short and should take less than ten minutes to complete. Your responses to the survey are confidential. Your individual responses will not be reported to anyone. Reports and findings will only include aggregate data and small groupings of data will be suppressed to avoid the possibility of attributing survey responses to an individual student. </p>



<p>If you have problems linking to and completing the survey, please contact Anna Pasillas-Santoyo, Associate Director of Institutional Research, at apasil1@uic.edu for assistance.</p>



<p>We would appreciate hearing from you so we can get a better sense of how you are doing and ways that we can improve your experience as a student at UIC during this crisis period. We know this is a busy time for you and we really appreciate your attention to this survey.</p>

<div style="text-align: left"><span><span style="text-decoration: underline">Vitalant to begin collecting plasma from individuals who have recovered from coronavirus to help COVID-19 patients</span><br />
Since 2014, The University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System has partnered with Vitalant for supply of blood products and transfusion services.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left"><span><br />
<strong>Convalescent Plasma: What Is It and How Do Patients Benefit?</strong><br />
Those who have completely recovered from COVID-19 may have immune-boosting antibodies in their plasma—called “convalescent plasma”—that could be used to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients.<br />
The Food and Drug Administration just allowed the transfusion of convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment. It’s currently the only antibody treatment available for COVID-19 patients.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left"><span><br />
<strong>Who is Eligible to Donate Convalescent Plasma and Where Will It Be Collected?</strong><br />
Current criteria include:<br />
•prior diagnosis of COVID-19, documented by a laboratory test<br />
•complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days<br />
•a current negative test result for COVID-19<br />
•all other donor eligibility for blood donation<br />
Vitalant does NOT test for COVID-19. Do not donate blood if you are sick.<br />
The donor must present the appropriate documentation to Vitalant donation center staff upon check-in.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: left"><span><br />
<strong>Are you a potential donor who has completely recovered from COVID-19?</strong><br />
Thank you for your interest in helping patients. Please contact us at 312-413-5972 and we will provide you with additional information about how to qualify as a convalescent plasma donor.</span></div>

<p>The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI) and the University of Illinois System (U of I) are launching a Joint Research and Innovation Seed Grants Program for university research scientists.</p>
<p>This program aims to facilitate research and development cooperation and delivery of talent, innovations and resources from these universities to the marketplace. The program will be interdisciplinary and the review process will assess innovation and commercialization potential. The goal is to promote economic development through R&amp;D of innovative technologies, while facilitating cooperation between the two universities.</p>
<p>Priority areas for the program include agriculture, artificial intelligence, data science and medicine. Interdisciplinary initiatives are being encouraged. The program intends to support both initial and more advanced steps in a proof-of-concept collaboration.</p>
<p><a href="https://vpedi.uillinois.edu/joint-research-and-innovation-seed-grants">Applications</a> should address the commercial viability of the project; technical details and overall planning; clarification of intellectual property rights that are likely to be generated (position and strategy); plans for securing funding for the project at the end of this seed grant, and other forms of commercial discussion that are envisioned.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">FULBRIGHT PROGRAM UPDATE</p>
<p>Dear Faculty,</p>
<p>Please be advised of an important announcement regarding the U.S. Fulbright Program. I will keep sharing updates as they are received from the Fulbright Commission. In the meantime, please email <a href="mailto:oia@uic.edu">oia@uic.edu</a> with any questions.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Nora Bonnin<br />
OGE-OIA</p>
<p>MESSAGE FROM FULBRIGHT:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State is continuously monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, and is working closely with partner governments, Fulbright Commissions, U.S. Embassies, Fulbright cooperating agencies, and U.S. and foreign host institutions to provide guidance and information to our Fulbright exchange participants. We share your concerns for everyone’s health, safety, and well-being, and are focused on supporting all Fulbrighters at this time.</p>
<p>On March 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of State issued a Global Level 4 Health Advisory &#8211; Do Not Travel which instructs all Americans abroad to either return to the United States or prepare to shelter in place.</p>
<p>As a result of this advisory, the Fulbright Program is now suspended for all U.S. participants. We urge all current U.S. Fulbright participants to make arrangements to return to the United States as soon as possible.</p>
<p>An email has been sent to program participants which provides detailed information about arranging travel, financial considerations, and things to consider while preparing for your return to the United States.</p>
<p>In these unprecedented circumstances, we also recognize that due to conditions in specific countries, including the closing of borders and air space, the lack of available flights, or other safety considerations, not all U.S. Fulbright participants will be able to depart for the United States at this time. If you find yourself in this situation, please refer to your email for guidance and be in contact with your Fulbright administrators in your host country.</p>
<p>As circumstances are evolving, all Fulbrighters should remain in close contact with their Fulbright Program administrators, advisors, and/or their Fulbright binational commissions.</p>
<p>Your Fulbright Commission, U.S. Embassy, and/or IIE, will make every effort to assist you during this time, and we ask that all specific questions about your situation be sent to your advisor, as they have the most relevant information for your country and case. Please know that, at this difficult time, Fulbright advisors and Fulbright Commission staff are working diligently to provide support to each participant.</p>
<p>The above program suspension applies only to American citizens currently participating in the U.S. Fulbright Program abroad. Foreign Fulbrighters on programs in the United States, as part of the Fulbright Foreign Student and Visiting Scholar Programs, should contact their Fulbright Program administrators to inquire about any changes in their situations.</p>
<p>For general information regarding COVID-19, please visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of State’s www.travel.state.gov page Current Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease.</p>
<p><strong>For more information, please contact:</strong><br />

<p>The UIC Department of Public Administration invites you to join us on March 4th at 5:30 pm for an information session to learn about our masters degrees in public administration, public policy, and civic analytics.</p>
<p>The Master of Public Administration (MPA) is the premier degree for those that wish to manage government agencies and nonprofits, and for those in the private sector that wish to specialize in intergovernmental relations, philanthropy, and regulatory affairs. Our program offers a diverse array of concentrations and specializations and tracks, including public management, nonprofit management, urban governance, and public policy.</p>
<p>The Master of Public Policy (MPP) prepares students to analyze and evaluate information in order to address complex policy issues. Graduates from MPP programs are sought after analysts and leaders because of their ability to evaluate and synthesize large datasets, coupled with an in-depth understanding of the contexts in which policy solutions are implemented.</p>
<p>The Master of Science in Civic Analytics (MSCA) is a first of its kind degree that combines study in civic technology and data analytics for those in the government and nonprofit sectors. Graduates will have technical skills that will be highly desirable in many employer contexts, including information offices in city, state and federal agencies; nonprofits; consulting firms, and government contractors.</p>
<p>Our masters programs accept students with a diverse array of undergraduate majors, and all three can be completed in full or part-time status.</p>
<p>Are you a current UIC Public Policy Major that is considering graduate school? Stop by and learn about our joint degree program; you can graduate with your Bachelor of Arts in Public Policy and Master&#8217;s degree in as little as 5 years!</p>
<p>Please RSVP by March 3rd at <a href="http://go.uic.edu/learn2lead">go.uic.edu/learn2lead</a></p>
