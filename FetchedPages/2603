<p>There’s growing concern for the homeless community since COVID-19 arrived in Chicago.</p>



<p>That’s why various nonprofits, shelters, city and health care leaders have come together to address the problems those experiencing homelessness are facing while protecting public health.</p>



<p>The Unsheltered Chicago Coalition, formerly known as the Westside COVID Response Team, is brainstorming ways to prevent or mitigate COVID outbreaks in the city&#8217;s shelters, where some of the most medically vulnerable live in crowded open areas, prone to be cluster sites. Each day, the team hosts two conference calls with community leaders, city government and providers.</p>



<p>UIC’s Dr. Stockton Mayer said the intent of the response team is to “advocate for an appropriate population-specific response” to COVID-19 in the city’s homeless population.</p>



<p>“I joined the group because many of our clients at the Community Outreach Intervention Projects (School of Public Health) experience homelessness,” said Mayer, assistant professor of clinical medicine in the College of Medicine. “We didn’t feel we had a solution for how to best serve them as providers.”</p>



<p><strong>Pulling from city&#8217;s resources</strong></p>



<p>The Unsheltered Chicago Coalition is a collaboration between some of the city’s health providers — Rush University Medical Center, UI Health, Cook County Health, Lawndale Christian Health Center, Salvation Army and Heartland Alliance in particular.</p>



<p>Mayer co-leads the testing team at multiple shelters in the city.&nbsp; The team responds to outbreaks at shelters throughout the city.&nbsp;In addition to testing, they offer infection control support, personal protective equipment or PPEs, and provider support.</p>



<p>“Pacific Garden Mission was one of the first shelters where we tested broadly,” he said. “However, we’ve tested over 1,000 citizens in the last two weeks.”</p>



<p>Mayer and UIC infectious disease chief Dr. Richard Novak also are guiding development of screening and point of care testing in Westside crisis shelters. Another UIC doctor on the team has developed infection control guidelines for the shelters to follow.</p>



<p>A big concern right now, Mayer said, is finding housing solutions for those who recover from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Dr. Evelyn Figueroa, professor of clinical family medicine, family medicine residency program director and community activist, developed an emergency COVID response team for Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago&#8217;s largest homeless shelter. Through that operation, the first and largest homeless shelter COVID isolation unit was opened on April 10 and has provided infirmary-level care for over 160 individuals experiencing homelessness. The PGM Emergency COVID Medical Response Team is composed of family medicine residents, medical students, registered nurses, and additional clinicians from UI Health, Rush Medical Center and Lawndale Christian Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of adults and children are living with unstable housing. The infection control aspects of COVID (hand hygiene, masking, social distancing, education) present significant challenges to people experiencing homelessness,&#8221; Figueroa said. &#8220;Public go-to places for sink bathing and phone charging are closed due to the stay-at-home order. By recognizing and addressing the unique medical and social challenges that homeless shelters face, we have successfully provided both COVID-related care as well as primary care, medication-assisted treatment and social services.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stephen Brown, UI Health director of preventive emergency medicine, plays a logistical role. In a community with resources already stretched thin, he was recently able to work with colleagues at Cook County Health to mine data sources and assemble a list that identified 425 congregate living facilities — places typically for residents 55 years of age or older —to help as many people as they can.</p>



<p>Centene, the largest Medicaid insurance carrier in the state, approached Brown last week. After a brief video conference, Centene’s team donated 100,000 masks and $150,000.</p>



<p>Brown has built relationships over several years with law enforcement, EMS, mental health, substance use and city agencies.</p>



<p>“I listen to the calls and connect in resources that will be useful to the team,” he said. “At the moment, I am lining up de-escalation training for shelter staff for those patients with serious mental illness that may be decompensating.”</p>



<p><strong>Keeping people informed</strong></p>

<p>While the Unsheltered Chicago Coalition is acting as a citywide resource hub, a group of UIC students has joined forces to support Stockton’s team if needed during the pandemic. They are on the ground doing screenings, supporting community-based testing, supporting staff testing, and calling on local organizations to identify their needs.</p>



<p>The organization, called COVID Rapid Response Team Chicago, or COVID RRT Chicago, has more than 250 UIC volunteers accepting requests for help. The volunteers include graduate and undergraduate students in medicine, nursing, applied psychology, and physical and occupational therapy.</p>



<p>The team provides daily symptom screenings at shelters to help track spread of COVID-19 and to protect the guests. They have implemented ‘shelter support days,’ which includes medication packaging, preparing supplies, and providing enrichment activities to the guests, including informational health sessions and interactive/creative activities. Right now, Pacific Garden Mission is the focus of their screenings.</p>



<p>”This is why I&#8217;m in medicine,” said co-organizer Sofia Sami, a new medical school graduate of UIC. “This moment is going to leave a huge impact on Chicago and many people globally. It will and should force us to think of community medicine, organized medicine, social medicine, and our lack of public health infrastructure.</p>



<p>As lead strategist for the group, Sami supports Dr. Mayer&#8217;s team with rapid testing in shelter sites, and throughout the day, participates on different partner project calls working to carve out opportunities for support — at UI Health and broadly in the community.</p>



<p>The group has created a volunteer training manual that outlines safety precautions, PPE and screening protocols that have been approved by physicians who are working with them to provide the screenings.</p>



<p>“We are the future of health care. We have dedicated our life’s work to improving the health and well-being of the population, yet there is no clear role for us in the response to the COVID pandemic,” said co-organizer Taylor Vandenberg, a first-year medical student at UIC.  </p>



<p>Vandenberg said being a medical student right now is a very emotionally charged experience that many are struggling to cope with.</p>



<p>“I wanted to use my understanding of health and medicine to fill in the gaps that our health care providers cannot always reach due to overwhelming need in hospitals and clinics,” she said. “Those realizations led me to this work, helping to protect the health and well-being of a very vulnerable population, which I have found to be a highly valuable experience.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, Vandenberg said, choosing how to respond to this pandemic is a very complex and personal decision.</p>



<p>“Whatever you are doing, whether it be active volunteering, remote volunteering/research, or simply abiding by the shelter-in-place policy and taking care of yourself, there is no right or wrong approach,” she said.</p>



<p>Other schools participating in the COVID RRT Chicago include Northwestern University, Rush University, University of Chicago, Loyola, and Rosalind Franklin University in North Chicago.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[UIC's Bellur S. Prabhakar is leading effort to produce 160,000 vials of Virus Transport Medium]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2014/02/DG08_01_01_053-387x258.jpg" alt="Bellur S.

<p>University of Illinois at Chicago was selected by the state to produce 160,000 vials of Virus Transport Medium (VTM) — a crucial testing material for COVID-19 — and make them available to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Currently, there is a shortage of VTM throughout the nation as the demand for COVID-19 tests continues to increase. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was contacted by the Governor’s office and asked whether UIC could help out,” said Bellur Prabhakar, UIC professor of microbiology and immunology and senior associate dean for research in the College of Medicine. “Given UIC’s commitment to fighting COVID-19 pandemic and our earlier experience with SARS, it was an easy decision.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prabhakar’s work has been <a href="https://today.uic.edu/inventor-of-the-year-bellur-s-prabhakar">recognized</a> for developing therapeutic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.706">monoclonal antibodies</a> against SARS and identifying <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/8/4353">antiviral molecules</a> to make SARS vaccines more effective. </p>



<p>UIC started production of the VTM last week.</p>



<p>“Although we have been given 6 to 8 weeks to fill the order, we fully expect to deliver all 160,000 vials to the state well before the end of this month,” Prabhakar said. </p>



<p>Prabhakar and colleagues gathered the four required materials to create the VTM from across the country quickly — in less than three days. Once the VTM is made and sterilized, they also perform quality control to ensure the absence of any microorganisms. </p>



<p>VTM is a critical component for COVID-19 testing. A nasal swab is placed in the VTM to prevent degradation of COVID-19 that may be present in patients’ samples. This gives the state up to a week for shipping and testing.</p>



<p>Also involved in this project are UIC&#8217;s Prabhakaran Kumar and Stefan Green of UIC and volunteers from the UIC Research Resource Center and College of Medicine.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>We know this spring has been difficult for UIC students. We are sending a student survey to students&#8217; UIC email addresses to check in and see how you are doing, and to give you the opportunity to tell us what is working and what is not working. The results of this survey will help us evaluate our activities this semester as well as develop plans for the future.</p>



<p>Your participation in this survey is voluntary. There are no penalties if you decide not to participate or if you choose to skip any questions. The survey is short and should take less than ten minutes to complete. Your responses to the survey are confidential. Your individual responses will not be reported to anyone. Reports and findings will only include aggregate data and small groupings of data will be suppressed to avoid the possibility of attributing survey responses to an individual student. </p>



<p>If you have problems linking to and completing the survey, please contact Anna Pasillas-Santoyo, Associate Director of Institutional Research, at apasil1@uic.edu for assistance.</p>



<p>We would appreciate hearing from you so we can get a better sense of how you are doing and ways that we can improve your experience as a student at UIC during this crisis period. We know this is a busy time for you and we really appreciate your attention to this survey.</p>

<p>UIC is recognizing more than 250 students across 16 colleges for their engagement on campus and in the community. </p>



<p>Together, these students have logged 3,270 hours of volunteer service and have actively participated in more than 400 student organizations. </p>



<p>They have volunteered in community hospitals and clinics, served meals at local homeless and women&#8217;s shelters, tutored and mentored Chicago-area children, volunteered as crisis counselors, and more. </p>



<p>These students are recipients of the Chancellor’s Student Service Award, Eugertha Bates Memorial Award, Jane Addams Distinguished Service Award, President’s Volunteer Service Award and Activities Honorary Society.  UIC also recognizes outstanding student groups with Student Organization Awards.</p>



<p>Here are the winners: </p>



<p><strong>Student Organization of the Year Award</strong>:<strong> American Marketing Association </strong><br>Student organizations are the hub of student activity on campus. They provide opportunities for students to enrich their campus life. We are fortunate to have a diverse group of student organizations that spend numerous hours volunteering, not only at UIC, but also in the Chicagoland community. They conquer new horizons through innovative planning, resourcefulness, determination, and steadfast commitment. The Student Organization of the Year Award allows us to honor their efforts and thank them for their contributions.</p>



<p><strong>Commitment to Diversity Student Organization Award</strong>:<strong> Alternative Spring Break</strong><br>The University of Illinois at Chicago is one of the most diverse campuses in the country and we are fortunate to have a wealth of cultures represented within our community. Students attend a university that seeks to foster an environment where social development and cultural learning opportunities can occur. The Commitment to Diversity Award recognizes an individual, event, or organization that provided a forum for cultural awareness, understanding, and/or education to flourish. The recipient of this award will have displayed a commitment to diversity by extending an opportunity for our students to be culturally enlightened and enriched.</p>



<p><strong>New Student Organization of the Year Award</strong>: <strong>American Medical Women’s Association for Pre-Health Students</strong><br>Annually, 20–30 new student organizations join the university community. These new student organizations work to establish themselves as student leaders, while creating opportunities for their peers to grow and develop and contribute to UIC. The nominees demonstrate outstanding potential for growth and development of its members and leaders to create a vibrant UIC experience. This award recognizes one student organization each year that has demonstrated true excellence among its peers within UIC’s community.</p>



<p><strong>Student Organization Advisor of the Year Award</strong>: <strong>Dr. Som Ale UNICEF at UIC</strong><br>Advisors are the unsung heroes of many student organizations. It is their selfless dedication to assisting student groups as they achieve their goals that makes advisors a valuable resource. Whether it is by attending meetings, organizing events, or simply providing a listening ear, advisors play a vital role within student organizations. Since 1981, Center for Student Involvement has awarded the Advisor of the Year Award to the individual whose exemplary service has not only benefited the students with whom they work, but also the UIC campus and surrounding community.</p>



<p><strong>Eugertha Bates Memorial Award</strong><br> The Eugertha Bates Memorial Award is given in recognition of a student whose volunteer and leadership activities in a campus and/or community setting demonstrate a significant level of caring, dedication, and selfless commitment to others. Nominees for this award must have made an exceptional contribution to the humanitarian needs of others. </p>

UIC is pleased to partner with the President’s Council to recognize our students whose work, service, and community contributions merit recognition with this award – as we believe it can set a standard for service, encourage a sustained commitment to civic participation, and inspire others to make service a central part of their lives. This award is presented to students whose volunteer service matched or exceeded at least 100 hours of service work since the beginning of the school year.</p>

<p><strong>Activities Honorary Society</strong><br>The Activities Honorary Society (AHS) was chartered in 1950 at the University of Illinois Undergraduate Division of the University of Illinois when it was housed at Navy Pier. The intent of its founders was to recognize undergraduate students who demonstrate broad and deep involvement in co-curricular activities. This 70-year-old honorary society is one of the oldest traditions at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and its purpose remains the same today.</p>



<p>Students selected for induction into
AHS have served in at least three diverse organizations and/or in a diverse set
of activities within them. Nominees must be in good academic standing (minimum
of 2.5/4.0 grade-point average) with at least 72 academic credit hours
completed by the end of the spring term in which they are nominated. These
individuals serve as examples to their fellow students who aspire to similar
levels of involvement for the betterment of the campus.</p>



<p>Nominations are made by faculty
members, advisors, mentors, staff, and students, and are subjected to a
rigorous selection process in which the student’s contributions to the
University are evaluated in terms of demonstrated leadership qualities, level
of involvement, administrative skill, and overall contributions to the student
experience at UIC. The selection is made by a committee of alumni, some of whom
have previously been inducted into AHS, thus making the honor unique among
other UIC student awards. No more than 15 inductees are selected each year.</p>

<p><strong>Chancellor’s Student Service Award</strong><br>Since 1973, the Chancellor’s Student Service Award (CSSA) has honored students who have made an outstanding contribution to the University through campus and community service. Student recipients must contribute a significant amount of time, effort, and creativity to one or more campus and/or community service projects.

The service activities of our students vary greatly each year as they contribute to both the university and community. Some examples of their contributions are:</p>



<ul><li>Volunteering in community hospitals and health
clinics</li><li>Serving meals and educating children at
homeless and women’s shelters</li><li>Tutoring at various educational and public
service institutions</li><li>Planning and coordinating academic and service
conferences</li><li>Organizing students to lobby on behalf of
environmental concerns</li><li>Serving on search, advisory, scholarship, and
ad-hoc University committees</li><li>Educating and mentoring students</li><li>Volunteering as crisis counselors</li><li>Fundraising for medical, political, and
educational causes</li><li>Organizing and volunteering at cultural events</li><li>Providing guidance and resources to UIC

<p>The current situation is very difficult and scary. It&#8217;s extremely hard to remain optimistic with such uncertain waves rushing toward us. It seems that the world has flooded with loss in more ways than one.</p>



<p>On a lighter note, hopefully, all my fellow extroverts are doing well. I’m warming up to the idea of staying indoors nearly 24/7 after about a month. My roommate has been preparing for this her entire life, I’d direct quote her but she’s in the zone studying. </p>



<p>Chicago’s vibrant energy has halted from my window, resembling the beginning of a zombie film. To my luck, the actual school and work transition has been smooth for me technology-wise. My professors have done a great job turning to online resources, some for the very first time. </p>



<p>The days have slowly melded together, turning into names of assignments that are due instead of “Tuesday.” Studying from my bed has always been a routine, but not going to class has been more of a challenge. I do miss walking through the quad in the morning and genuinely sitting in a classroom. It’s funny to think that I’m longing to get lost in the maze that is the Behavioral Sciences Building. </p>



<p>I
will admit seeing the faces of my peers and professors is uplifting when class
is held using Zoom or Blackboard Collaborate. I’ve been able to stay fairly
positive throughout the experience even though it has its difficulties, I
recognize my fortunate circumstances and have enjoyed some of the free time I
do have to watch films and paint. Admittedly, having to settle into a new
routine has made me appreciate my old one far more. </p>



<p>The experience is made easier by my best friend and roommate who keeps me motivated. Surprisingly, she has been able to keep up with the greater amount that I ramble now that I can only speak to one person face to face daily. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, I cannot express my appreciation enough for how well the faculty and staff of UIC has accommodated the students living on campus during this time. </p>



<p>My experience throughout this is comparable to riding the “L” during rush hour, stuffy but grateful for the ride. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[Convalescent plasma collection, treatments begin this week ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>The UI Health is the first health system to partner with Vitalant, formerly LifeSource, on a pilot program to treat patients with active, severe cases of COVID-19 with blood plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19. </p>



<p>Known as &#8220;convalescent plasma,” this blood product contains antibodies that may give patients an extra boost to fight their life-threatening illness. </p>



<p>“UI Health is extremely pleased to be the first health care system to participate in the Vitalant convalescent plasma program in Chicagoland as it brings a promising investigational treatment to hospitalized patients who are battling severe COVID-19 infections in our area,” said UIC&#8217;s Dr. Sally Campbell-Lee, associate head of pathology and director of clinical affairs for the department. </p>



<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified and approved convalescent plasma treatment as an &#8220;emergency investigational new drug&#8221; based on results of similar treatments of past diseases such as Ebola.&nbsp; </p>



<p>“Convalescent plasma is currently the only antibody treatment available to COVID-19 patients and as such, is a promising new tool,&#8221; said Dr. Mona Papari, senior chief medical officer for Vitalant-Illinois. &#8220;Because of its potential, the FDA, along with hospitals and blood centers such as Vitalant have quickly responded with a program which combines the strength of each organization with the altruism of the recovered donors to assist critically ill patients.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vitalant’s partner hospitals will be operating under FDA investigational protocols — hospitals have obtained blanket or emergency Investigational New Drug, eIND, application approval from the FDA — and are poised to screen potential donors. Once donor eligibility is confirmed, Vitalant will work with the hospitals to collect and process the plasma.</p>



<p>Those over the age of 16 who have had and recovered from COVID-19, and want to donate plasma are encouraged to apply at: <a href="http://vitalant.org/covidfree">vitalant.org/covidfree</a>. </p>



<p>Current criteria include: </p>



<ul><li>over the age of 16 (16-year-olds require parental consent)</li><li>prior diagnosis of COVID-19, documented by a laboratory test</li><li>complete resolution of symptoms for at least 28 days or complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days and a negative test result for COVID-19</li><li>all other donor eligibility for an automated plasma donation</li></ul>



<p>Even with these requirements, there may be additional tests or other criteria required. In some instances, those who have recovered from COVID-19 may be able to donate, even if they did not have an initial laboratory test. </p>



<p>Donors and physicians should
consult the most current <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma#Collection%20of%20COVID-19">FDA
guidance</a>. In addition, hospitals and physicians are encouraged to
visit <a href="http://www.vitalant.org/covidfree">vitalant.org/covidfree</a> for
more information. </p>



<p>Vitalant will only accept donors who have recovered from COVID-19 after they have been evaluated and cleared by a physician.&nbsp;This ensures that only fully recovered individuals are entering Vitalant facilities and donating plasma. Donors must be fully approved to participate in the program prior to arriving at a Vitalant Community Donation Center. </p>



<p>More information is available at 866-CV-PLSMA (866-287-5762) or email <a href="mailto:covidfree@vitalant.org">covidfree@vitalant.org</a>. </p>

<p>By Deborah Ziff Soriano</p>
<p>It was after seeing a news story on COVID-19 patients at University of Illinois Hospital that Megan Cairns Tress, MS ’18, FNP, had a “lightning bolt of inspiration.”</p>
<p>The story featured alumnus Daniel Ortiz, MS ’17, RN, sharing his experience working on the COVID ward, with the headline, ‘Patients are Terrified in Their Hospital Beds.’</p>
<p>“As soon as I saw that I was like, ‘holy smokes,’” said Tress, who is a family nurse practitioner at PCC Community Wellness and a clinical instructor at UIC Nursing. “[The patients] can’t have any visitors and they likely didn’t bring their cell phone chargers. No one remembers phone numbers anymore. If they can’t use their phones, they’ve lost that vital contact point.”</p>
<p>Tress started a fundraising campaign to raise money to buy cell phone chargers for area hospitals and quickly raised about $1,200. She found a wholesaler and was able to buy 700 chargers within three days, more than enough for every bed at University of Illinois Hospital and West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park, where they have already been distributed.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of positive feedback,” she says, adding that people were saying: “‘Wow, what a small thing, but so practical.’”</p>
<p>Tress began partnering with Jon Hefler, a San Diego man who went on a similar mission after his father was hospitalized with COVID-19 and needed a phone charger. The two are now taking their initiative nationwide. Together, they’ve raised more than $33,000 and shipped chargers to more than five states. With the initiative growing rapidly — her story has been featured on WTTW — Tress has created a small team to work on contacting hospitals and distribution, including BSN student Ana Maria Malicdem.</p>
<p><strong>‘I saved a life’</strong><br />Tress was doing this while also working a COVID-19 hotline at PCC Wellness Center, which takes calls from all comers, regardless of whether they are PCC patients or insured.</p>
<p>“The biggest goal of the hotline is to keep people out of the hospital,” she said, adding that she’s taken some 500 calls and kept nearly all of them out of the emergency room by talking them through symptom management.</p>
<p>Still, when someone exhibits critical symptoms, such as not being able to breathe, she encourages them to go to the hospital, which is what happened with one patient who concerned Tress so much that she doggedly followed up with her for four days after their initial conversation.</p>
<p>When they finally connected, Tress said the patient was delirious and didn’t even know her own address. Tress told the patient’s partner to take her to the hospital and called ahead to have her admitted to the ICU.</p>
<p>When she finally heard back from the patient’s partner (coincidentally, Tress suspects their cell phones died in the hospital), he told her, “‘We’re OK, but we might not have been if you hadn’t called back.’”</p>
<p>“I was bawling,” she said. “It was the first time I really felt like I saved a life. And it was through that hotline.”</p>
