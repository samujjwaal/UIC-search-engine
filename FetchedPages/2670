<ul>
<li>Three new chapters have been added and others have been updated and/or reorganized.</li>
<li> One Chapter is dedicated to <a href="http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-learning/open-world-learning.pdf">Open World Learning</a>
<li> <b>Any AI system (e.g., chatbot and self-driving car) that cannot learn in deployment (e.g., chatting and driving) in the real-world open envoronment is not truly intelligent.</b>
</ul>

<b>Motivation</b>: Sooner or later, AI agents will need to explore and learn 
by themsleves in the real world. They cannot forever depend 
on manually labeled data. The real world is open and dynamic, and
full of unknowns. AI agents must be able to detect the unknowns and 
learn them in a self-supervised manner. They should not make 
the <i> <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1061">closed-world assumption</a></i> any more. 

<p> <b>Open world machine learning</b> (a.k.a. <b>open world recognition or classification, </b> or <b>open-world AI)</b> is getting increasingly important as the learning agent is increasingly <b>working in or facing the real-world open and dynamic environment</b>, e.g., chatbot and self-driving car, where the agent <b>cannot assume or expect</b> 
what it will see in the real-world contains only what it has learned previously. For example, a chatbot cannot assume that it knows everything that a user may say. A self-driving car cannot assume that the real-world has only things that it has seen and learned before. <b>The core of open-world learning or open-world AI is about recognizing unknowns and learning them so that the AI agent will become more and more knowledgeable</b>. 

<p> Classic machine learning makes the <i><b><a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1061">closed world assumption</a></b></i>, i.e., the classes that the agent sees in training are what it will see in testing (no new objects or classes can appear in testing) (Fei and Liu 2016). A more realistic scenario is to expect <b>unseen classes</b> during testing (open world). In this case, the goal is to design a learning algorithm that can classify data of the known/seen classes into their respective classes and also to reject/detect instances from unknown/unseen classes. This problem is called <b>open-world learning (or open-world classification)</b>. Apart from detecting the unseen classes, open-world learning should also incrementally or continually learn the new classes. 

<h3>Tasks of open-world learning (OWL)</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Task 1</b>: learn a classifier that can perform classification of test instances that belong to training/seen 
classes used in learning, and detect/reject instances that do not belong to 
the training/seen classes - (the <b>DOC</b> algorithm (<a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/emnlp17-camera-ready.pdf">EMNLP-2017</a>) 
is quite powerful for this task for both text and images). 
<ul> <li>Note - <b>Rejection here is not the same as the traditional outlier/anormaly detection</b>. Tradtional outlier detection typically detects outliers 
from a given dataset based on some unsupervised learning methods, while 
rejection in open-world learning detects unseen class instances ("outliers") on the 
fly in testing using the classifier trained with only seen class examples (supervised learning), 
and the classifier also does classification of test instances from the 
seen classes. 
</ul>
<li> <b>Task 2</b>: ask the user to provide the unseen classes in the 
rejected instances or automatically discover the unseen classes based 
on the knowledge learned in the past (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05609">Shu et al. 2018</a>).
<li> <b>Task 3</b>: incrementally learn the new/unseen classes 
(<a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rpp0426-feiA.pdf">Fei et al. 2016</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06004">Xu et al. 2019</a>) 
without retraining from scratch and without catastrophic forgetting. 
</ul>
<p>In the process, the system learns and accumulates more and more knowledge (<a href="http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rpp0426-feiA.pdf">Fei et al. 2016</a>). 
The learner is <i>self-motivated</i> and <i>it knows what it does and does not know.</i> With intelligent systems such as chatbots and self-driving cars increasingly facing the real-world open (unknown) environments, we can no longer make the <b>closed world assumption</b>.
