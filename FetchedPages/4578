                AHRQ has issued a notice to inform grantees of the agency’s intention to provide short-term administrative flexibilities for management of AHRQ grants. Like other federal agencies, AHRQ is adopting the administrative relief provisions outlined by OMB in memorandum M-20-17. These include extension of deadlines, no cost extensions, and allowability of salaries, among others. Full details are available <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-20-010.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>.

                AHRQ has released two Notices of Intent for upcoming funding opportunities designed to support studies evaluating health system and healthcare professional responsiveness to COVID-19. The agency plans to publish notices calling for both urgent revision supplements to existing AHRQ grants, and for novel high-impact studies to be funded through the R01 mechanism.

Competitive revision <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-20-007.html">supplements</a> for existing projects  (anticipated ~$2.5M in supplemental funds to be made available) should capitalize on the expertise of grant personnel and the institutional environment to expand the specific aims of the on-going research to develop high-impact new knowledge concerning COVID-19. It is anticipated RFPs will be released in April with an opening date of mid-May.
<ul>
 	<li>o For new studies related to COVID-19, AHRQ is interested in critical research focused on evaluating topics such as innovations and challenges encountered in the rapid expansion of telemedicine in response to COVID-19, effects on quality, safety, and value of health system response to COVID-19, and the role of primary care practices and professionals during the COVID-19 epidemic. AHRQ is particularly interested in understanding how digital health innovations contributed to health system and healthcare professional innovation and challenges and solutions to meeting the needs of vulnerable populations including older adults, people living with multiple chronic conditions, in rural communities and uninsured and underinsured populations. AHRQ expects to dedicate $5 million to this program. The agency plans to release the Funding Opportunity Announcement for these grants in early May 2020, with an expected deadline in June 2020. The Notice of Intent for this initiative can be found <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HS-20-008.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Fund received $300 million in the COVID-19 emergency supplemental package. This fund was created in FY 2019 and had roughly $100 million in reserve funding prior to the emergency supplemental. This funding can be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to an infectious disease emergency, domestic or international. Money from this fund has previously been used to respond to an Ebola outbreak in the Congo. CDC has not yet posted specific opportunities; when postings are available, we will update this page.</li>

                The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) released a Request for Information (RFI) for COVID-19 modeling and prediction analyses services. The goal of the RFI is to facilitate collaboration between a partnered laboratory and WRAIR investigators to provide immediate support to perform such analyses services. Potential analyses relevant to military health protection may include healthcare system predictions, epidemic spread predictions, clinical outcome predictions, resource allocation, and the impact of a range of non-pharmaceutical and _pharmaceutical interventions. Potential performers should have substantive publication-proven experience in prior epidemic virus forecasting and modeling, a history of publications of substantive modeling analyses specifically for COVID-19, extensive expertise in developing and implementing agent-based models which use notional/synthetic populations. Experience in applying modeling for advanced vaccine development is also a key capability.

                The Defense Pricing and Contracting office issued a memo describing procedures to reimburse defense contractors for providing paid leave to employees who can’t work during the pandemic mitigation period because they are unable to telework or access their government work sites. The memo implements Section 3610 of the CARES Act to allow agencies to reimburse contractors for paid leave and sick leave provided to employees or subcontractors to maintain a “ready state” during the national emergency. The memo is available <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/policy/policyvault/Implementation_Guidance_CARES_3610_DPC.pdf">here</a>.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued a memorandum providing guidance to the Intelligence Community (IC) on how to leverage flexibilities in the CARES Act to help their contractor employees continue to work and be compensated even if they are unable to access their government work sites. Intended to help contractors stay financially viable, maintain long-term health of the industrial base, and retain skilled and cleared contractors, the ODNI guidance implements provisions in Section 3610 of the CARES Act that authorize agencies to modify contracts when contract employees are restricted from work due to COVID-19-related health and safety concerns and encourages them to enable the maximum number of contractor personnel to convert to staying home in a “ready state” during the national emergency. ODNI said in the memo that it supports intelligence agency decisions to slip acquisition and development milestones, even if already required by approved documentation, if it is intended to limit staffing during the critical period for pandemic mitigation of March 27 through September 30, 2020. The memorandum can be found on the Lewis-Burke Associates <a href="https://www.lewis-burke.com/sites/default/files/odni_section_3610_guidance_memo.pdf">website</a>.

                <strong>Department of Education to Release CARES Emergency Student Funding </strong>

&nbsp;

The U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced plans for how it would distribute emergency student funding provided in the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund as authorized by the <em>Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security </em>(CARES) Act. Of the amount allocated to an institution, at least 50 percent must be reserved to provide students with emergency financial aid grants. The April 9 announcement of available grant funding focuses only on the grant portion to be distributed directly to students, with ED noting, "Institutions will receive allocations and guidance for the institutional share of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund in the coming weeks."

&nbsp;

In a cover letter sent to institutions, ED notes that "each institution may develop its own system and process for determining how to allocate these funds, which may include distributing the funds to all students or only to students who demonstrate significant need." ED provided additional details noting that to receive funds, institutions must download a certification document, review the document, have a campus leader sign, and submit through www.grants.gov. Submission of a certification form will trigger a release of funds in ED’s grants management system, G5. Funds will be available for draw down in 24-72 hours, starting Wednesday, April 15. ED emphasizes that these funds are only to provide cash to students; institutions are not permitted to use these funds to reimburse themselves for refunds (these include refunds for room and board, purchase of technology, and expenses already incurred). The certification form also states that institutions “should be mindful of each student’s particular socioeconomic circumstances in the staging and administration of these grants.”

&nbsp;

Congress has provided greater flexibility for the institutional portion of CARES Act funding, for which ED will outline the uses and methods by which institutions can use those funds for reimbursement. ED intends to hold a follow-up call, which will address questions about the institutional portion. Many institutions have noted that the current www.grants.gov system was not appropriately set up for the certification forms to be uploaded. At the time of this writing, ED has provided limited guidance and has noted the technical challenges they are having with www.grants.gov. When completing the certification form institutions should list only the allocation for the emergency student amount. ED has communicated that a “wet signature” is not necessary and the form can be completed by someone who has authority to receive funding on behalf of the institution. A letter from ED to institutions, the certification form, additional directions for applying for the funds, institutional allotments, and the methodology for calculating allocations is available <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresact.html">here</a>.

                ED released guidance providing additional regulatory flexibilities to institutions in several policy areas including verification, need analysis, and distance education. Previous guidance applied only to students enrolled in terms that ended on or before June 1, 2020; the updated guidance extends many of these flexibilities through June 30, 2020. One highlight of the new guidance that will be significant as aid from the CARES Act begins to flow to students relates to need analysis. The guidance states, “Any aid (in the form of grants or low interest loans) received by victims of an emergency from a federal or state entity for the purpose of providing financial relief is not counted as income for calculating a family’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC) under the Federal Methodology or as estimated financial assistance for packaging purposes.” Updated guidance is available <a href="https://ifap.ed.gov/electronic-announcements/040320UPDATEDGuidanceInterruptStudyRelCOVID19">here</a>.

                The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has started distributing an initial $30 billion in relief funding to hospitals and healthcare providers to help mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including lost revenue from cancelled elective procedures. Funding will be automatically disbursed to all healthcare facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019; no application or request for funding is required. Healthcare providers receiving funding must agree not to collect out-of-pocket payments for services provided to COVID-19 patients that would be greater than the cost to in-network patients (i.e. surprise medical bills). Within 30 days of receiving the payment, providers must sign an attestation signifying agreement to HHS’ terms and conditions, which will be available starting next week at https://www.hhs.gov/provider-relief/index.html.

This funding represents the first disbursement of a total $100 billion for provider relief included in the <em>Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act</em>. HHS has stated that in allocating the remaining $70 billion, the focus is on targeting distribution towards providers in areas particularly impacted by COVID-19, providers in rural areas, providers with lower shares of Medicare reimbursements (such as children’s hospitals), providers who primarily serve the Medicaid population, and providers requesting reimbursement for treatment of uninsured individuals.

Providers can estimate their payments by multiplying their 2019 Medicare FFS reimbursements by 0.062 (the approximate ratio of available funding to total 2019 Medicare FFS reimbursement made).

                The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) recently announced efforts to develop a COVID-19 Master Question List (MQL) with information on the status of current news and relevant research related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including critical gaps in knowledge of importance to first responders. These efforts are being led by S&amp;T’s new Probabilistic Analysis of National Threats, Hazards and Risks (PANTHR) Program and Hazard Awareness &amp; Characterization Technology Center. In addition to identifying gaps in knowledge, these teams will also look to develop research solutions in some cases. Although a majority of this research will likely be conducted internally at DHS and through existing partners, there is a good chance MQL topics could be included in future DHS S&amp;T funding opportunities. Additional information can be found <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/blog/2020/03/18/st-mobilizes-key-data-inform-covid-19-response">here</a>.

OJP also offered guidance for solicitations that require “executed agreements” or signed notices from decision-making authorities with research entities that certify their support for data collection as part of a research activity, agreements which are especially important to NIJ grants. Under the new guidance, OJP strongly encourages signed agreements if possible, but notes that they will not be required in forthcoming applications. Awardees will have to obtain signed agreements by January 1, 2021; funds will be withheld until such agreements can be submitted.

<ul>
 	<li>Work on missions currently in development (Phases A, B, and C) will continue remotely. Missions undergoing testing and integration are likely to experience greater repercussions. In the latter group, NASA will continue work to the extent practicable using smaller teams. Dr. Zurbuchen noted this will impact the James Webb Space Telescope, but that NASA remains committed to launching the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover this summer as scheduled.</li>
 	<li>Funding for individual investigator awards will be impacted. NASA is making modifications to ROSES 2020 program elements and will announce future modifications on NSPRIES. At this point, SMD has determined the following opportunities will be affected:
<ul>
 	<li>Step-1 due dates for the “Emerging Worlds”, “Solar System Observations”, and “Yearly Opportunities for Research in Planetary Defense” program elements will be postponed.</li>
 	<li>Step-2 due dates for the “Applied Information Systems Research” and “Interdisciplinary Consortia for Astrobiology Research” are now shifted to April 17, 2020.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
NASA is taking steps to provide clarity for future opportunities and current awardees. In the coming days, NASA
<ul>
 	<li>May change all Step-1 deadlines in the next 30 days to mandatory Notices of Intent.</li>
 	<li>Will no-cost extend or re-phase existing awards on a case-by-case basis.</li>
 	<li>Will exercise leniency in enforcing solicitation deadlines with accommodations made on a case-by-case basis.</li>

                NIH released a notice that all grant applications due between March 9, 2020 and May 1, 2020 will be accepted through May 1, 2020. This announcement applies to all relevant funding opportunity announcements, including those that indicate no late applications will be accepted. Institutions no longer need to request advance permission to submit late applications and a cover letter justifying the late submission is not required due to this declared emergency. For funding opportunity announcements that expire prior to May 1, 2020, NIH will extend the expiration date for 90 days to accommodate the submission of late applications. Under this new guidance, NIH anticipates, but cannot guarantee, that all late applications submitted by May 1, 2020 will be reviewed in the council round to which they were submitted.

                This NOSI highlights the urgent need for research on the COVID-19. NCATS is especially interested in research in the use of microphysiological systems or tissue chips in collecting and examining data on the risks and outcomes for COVID-19 infection, and advance the translation of research findings into diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.A multi-organ on chip approach is strongly encouraged though not required. Please document access to a BSL-3 facility or include scientific justification for use of alternative facilities, for example using an engineered a COVID-19 pseudovirus that expresses the key surface Spike protein, which mediates its entry into cells.

                This NOSI is issued in response to the urgent need for research on how coinfection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), might affect HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications (CCCs) within its mission. For this funding opportunity announcement, NIDDK is interested in studies to elucidate if COVID-19 might provoke or exacerbate noncommunicable gastrointestinal, liver, kidney/urological and metabolic/endocrine diseases in people with HIV (PWH) or worsen the consequences of viral hepatitis coinfection. Conversely, it is also important to elucidate whether people with HIV (PWH) with CCCs within the mission of NIDDK have different COVID-19 outcomes. Studies are expected to align with the HIV/AIDS research priorities outlined by the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) in <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-018.html">NOT-OD-20-018 UPDATE: NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities and Guidelines for Determining HIV/AIDS Funding.</a>

                <strong>Funding Lapses for Small Business Administration Loan Program as Congressional Negotiations Continue</strong>

&nbsp;

As of April 16<sup>th</sup>, the Small Business Administration (SBA) officially ran out of money for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) initiative, created by the <em>Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security </em>(CARES) Act to provide forgivable loans to eligible small businesses and non-profits. There is bipartisan consensus to replenish PPP funds, but there has been a prolonged impasse over whether the next support measure should narrowly focus on shoring up PPP, a position backed by Republican leadership, or the Democrat’s position that SBA funding be complemented by additional funds for hospitals, local governments, and other entities. Congressional leaders are expected to continue to negotiate with the White House on a suitable interim package to supplement CARES Act investments before turning to more future comprehensive stimulus legislation. Due to the Congressional Recess through at least May 4<sup>th</sup>, we will continue to provide updates on this situation as available.

Funding amount: up to $20M for 5 awards

Deadline: April 8, 2020 at 12:00 pm (NOON) ET

Specifically, MTEC is seeking “treatments with potential application to the prevention of COVID-19 infection” and “therapeutics that can be administered in a non-hospital environment”. MTEC anticipates eight-month projects starting at the proof-of-concept or laboratory validation stage (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 or 4) and ending with prototype demonstration (TRL 6). DOD anticipates a total of $20 million for 5 awards, with potential for follow-on funding for the manufacturing and clinical testing of therapeutics. White papers are due by <strong>April 8, 2020 at 12:00 pm ET</strong>.

It is anticipated <a href="https://beta.sam.gov/opp/53badf9fb02349e78839a541495efc6a/view#general">additional RPPs may be release</a>d related to topics described in MTEC’s pre-announcement, including:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Point-of-care diagnostic </strong>that provides rapid and accurate determination on exposure to COVID-19.</li>
 	<li><strong>Prophylactic(s)/Therapeutic(s) that can prevent and/or treat in a rapid manner (few hours to 2 days) potentially in a non-hospital environment</strong>. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs/biologics for prevention/treatment of COVID-19 or testing of drugs/biologics that have already demonstrated safety in humans for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 are preferred.</li>
 	<li><strong>Disease predictive modeling </strong>that provides early warning through data capture from several different streams of data to include <strong>social media and artificial intelligence (AI) </strong>parameter decision tools that would provide actionable information to medical service providers and command structures.</li>
 	<li><strong>Patient monitoring, tracking, and management system </strong>for in-home or non-hospital environment patient tele-health services to include interface into the Cerner electronic health record.</li>

                USAID has announced $274 million in emergency health and humanitarian funding to address COVID-19 since February. Activities supported by this funding include direct and indirect support to countries impacted by COVID-19 by providing heightened risk-communications and engagement with local communities; the prevention and control of infection in health facilities, including through the provision of personal protective equipment and other critical commodities; increasing laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity; the management of COVID-19 cases; screening at points of entry; and global and regional coordination. As these funds have been directed to multilateral institutions and to USAID missions for deployment by in-country partners, we do not anticipate any direct extramural funding opportunities for U.S.-based institutions. 

USAID has established an inbox (Covid19_Concepts@USAID.gov) for prospective partners to submit unsolicited proposals. Additional information is available <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/coronavirus/funding-requests-unsolicited-proposals">here</a>

                On April 16, President Trump announced the release of Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, the Administration’s three-phase plan to reopen the U.S. economy and resume activities. The Trump Administration acknowledged state and local governments will be responsible for implementing procedures to resume activities, tailored to each jurisdiction’s health circumstances. The plan, which assumes reopening activities will not occur until a 14-day downward trajectory of symptoms and COVID-19 cases as well as sufficiently available testing and hospital crisis care, offers a blueprint for phasing in allowable activities and continued health precautions for individuals and employers.
