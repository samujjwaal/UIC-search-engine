</div></figure>



<p>UIC is showcasing its impact on the
community during the COVID-19 pandemic with TV ads currently running on NBC5/Telemundo,
as well as digital advertisements. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ugKMF51FA">30-second TV ad</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbc6wqGSxH4">15-second digital spot</a>
are running in English and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvTayW6t7OQ">Spanish</a>
through May 17. The ads, which began April 22, also thank UI Health frontline
workers and UIC essential workers, honor UIC’s 2020 grads, celebrate resilience
and highlight UIC’s “Best Value” ranking from the Wall Street Journal/Times
Higher Education.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>&#8220;First and
foremost, we wanted to thank everyone who is working so tirelessly to ensure
that the important work at UIC continues,” said Katie Hession, director of UIC
Marketing and Brand Management. “Secondly, we wanted students and prospective
students to know that while the world is changing, the importance of their
degree won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>The TV ads have run during TV shows
such as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Dateline,” “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” and
more. Digital ads appear on websites that are part of Universal/Comcast’s
digital portfolio, such as Today.com, MSNBC.com, Bravo.com and more. </p>



<p>“We
chose&nbsp;NBC/Telemundo, the only dual language
station in Chicago —under one company, Universal/Comcast, which also delivers a
vast portfolio on the digital side,” Hession said.</p>



<p>Additional radio ads are currently
airing on WBEZ and WVON.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Health care workers can now participate in HERO research program ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>Health care workers at the University of Illinois
Hospital and Health Sciences System, or UI Health, are now eligible to
participate in a national registry of clinicians working on the frontlines of
the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p>UI Health is part of the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is among the first institutions in the nation to participate in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes Registry. </p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://heroesresearch.org/" target="_blank">HERO Registry</a> seeks to engage health care workers, understand their experiences and track their health outcomes related to the pandemic — from COVID-19 infection to stress and burnout. Participant experiences and health outcomes will be tracked via surveys and opportunities, to participate in clinical trials. </p>



<p>As part of the registry, health care workers at UI Health also will have the opportunity to participate in future COVID-19 clinical trials, such as an upcoming study of hydroxychloroquine&#8217;s effectiveness in preventing coronavirus infections in health care workers. This <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/hero-hcq/">study</a>, the first for the HERO Registry, will enroll approximately 15,000 health care workers from participating institutions in the clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine performs better than placebo at preventing COVID-19. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/experts/susan-bleasdale/susan-casey-bleasdale-md-fidsa-facp"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Susan Casey Bleasdale, MD, FIDSA, FACP" class="wp-image-92859" width="203" height="305" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></a><figcaption>Dr. Susan Bleasdale</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity for our health care workers to share their experiences and the challenges they face as frontline care providers,&#8221; said UIC&#8217;s Dr. Susan Bleasdale, associate professor of clinical medicine at the College of Medicine, medical director of infection prevention at UI Health and principal investigator of the HERO hydroxychloroquine study at UIC. &#8220;We need to study what is happening among health care providers with the same dedication we study what is happening to patients.</p>



<p>&#8220;This information is vital to understanding what
works and what doesn&#8217;t work as we start thinking through the best ways to protect
health care workers, emerge from this crisis and learn from it,&#8221; said
Bleasdale, who is an infectious disease expert. </p>



<p>Bleasdale said that documenting the experiences of health
care providers in real-time during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide invaluable
information to public health departments, hospitals and infectious disease
experts on how to prepare for future outbreaks or a second wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. </p>



<p>The hydroxychloroquine study is expected to begin
enrolling health care workers through the HERO registry on May 4.</p>



<p>The HERO research program leverages <a href="https://pcornet.org/">PCORnet</a>, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, and is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. </p>



<p>More information about the HERO Registry, which is led by Duke University, is available <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/">online</a>. </p>

<p>Borrowing a concept from quantum mechanics, a researcher from UIC’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department is improving our ability to get crucial health information from sensors embedded in medical implants.</p>
<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Associate Professor Pai-Yen Chen has greatly improved a reader that is integrated with wireless micro- and nano- sensors. He, along with Ramy El-Ganainy at Michigan Technological University, and Demetrios Christodoulides at the College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, used parity-time (PT) symmetry to increase the sensitivity and resolution of sensors used in wireless implants, resulting in far more accurate, clearer results. These implants are used in medical settings for monitoring heart failure, intraocular pressure and blood pressure, and could also have huge benefits outside of medical applications, including robotics, and radio frequency (RF) sensors in vehicles, airplanes and in other harsh environments.</p>
<p>Chen said he was attending an applied physics conference listening to a lecture on PT symmetry when he realized they could use the approach in an RF circuit.</p>
<p>“We don’t change the whole system or the sensor itself, but the way we read the results by means of wireless interrogation. It’s a very different approach,” said Chen. “Any small change in the microsensor’s electrical impedance due to, for example, physical forces can cause a large shift of resonant frequency seen in spectra of backscattered RF signals. Such results imply that sensitivity and resolvability of microsensors can be boosted.”</p>
<p>Chen is currently working with the UIC College of Medicine on a prototype of a PT symmetric wireless intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor, with hopes of potential commercialization. Eye pressure is the only known sign of glaucoma, which affects about three million Americans and is a leading cause of blindness.</p>
<p>Chen’s research group focuses on conducting theoretical modeling of light-matter interactions and radiation at the micro- and nano- scale, as well as exploring new physical phenomena and applications in the fields of nonlinear optics, optical sensing, photodetection, and energy harvesting. Chen is the recipient of several awards, including: NSF CAREER Award, ACES (Applied and Computational Electromagnetics Society) Early Career Award, SPIE Rising Researcher Award, IEEE Sensors Council Young Professional Award, IEEE Raj Mittra Travel Grant (RMTG) Award, Young Scientist Awards from URSI General Assembly and URSI Commission B: Electromagnetics, DoD and DoE fellowships.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Elena Zheleva aims to help algorithms gain insight into causality ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Elena-Zheleva-157x180-1.jpg" alt="Elena Zheleva" class="wp-image-93908"/><figcaption>Elena Zheleva</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>By Andrea Poet</strong></p>
<p>Even if we don’t realize it, machine-learning algorithms affect many of our everyday decisions: they can make recommendations on what to buy, what news to read, or whom to date. These algorithms do what they do by examining our previous choices and the choices of people who are similar to us. What they do not typically consider is the downstream impact of these recommendations: how we feel or how our perspectives change as a result.</p>
<p>It’s a missing piece that concerns Elena Zheleva, assistant professor of computer science. She hopes to resolve the problem by infusing “causal inference” into how algorithms are designed.</p>
<p>Zheleva offered an example of a Twitter post containing fringe political content. “An algorithm doesn’t consider how this tweet that is recommended to you will impact your life,” she said. “Would it enhance your life in some way, or would it contribute to radicalizing you?”</p>
<p>Gaining insight into causality — how different recommendations or interventions can help or harm us — is what Zheleva hopes to infuse into machine-learning algorithms, helping to reshape how they work.</p>
<p>“Machine-learning algorithms are used to impact many decisions in our life. That’s something [that] recommendation algorithms control, and we should be aware of the impact,” Zheleva said — especially whether the effect is negative or positive.</p>
<p>There is little research on how algorithms can maximize positive impact based on data collected in online settings, especially in rapidly changing environments. Zheleva has received grants to investigate solutions to this problem: one from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and another from Anthem.</p>
<p>The DARPA grant, which is in collaboration with the University of Southern California, isn’t solely about how algorithms affect the way people feel or what they perceive, but rather how algorithms can influence how people perform. She is studying human performance in several venues: online games, language-learning applications, and Stack Exchange, a network of question-and-answer websites where users vote on the questions and answers posted by others, leading the most highly endorsed posts to rise in reputation.</p>
<p>Zheleva’s algorithms will detect and analyze changes in a user’s performance and use that analysis to suggest tailored ways to improve attention and motivation. Her algorithm accounts for factors such as a user’s experience with a platform, the length of the user’s current session, and decisions that users make within sessions or games.</p>
<p>“We are looking different game characteristics that could affect team success,” Zheleva said.</p>
<p>For instance, if a user’s character gains or loses power in an online game, that may make some players become more fiercely competitive but cause others to lose interest and disengage. An algorithm that can keep a user engaged by recognizing and accommodating that person’s strengths and weaknesses could lead to a more successful outcome—depending on how you look at it, for the user, the platform, or both.</p>
<p>Zheleva’s other research project, funded by Anthem, is a collaboration with Houshang Darabi, an associate professor in UIC’s mechanical and industrial engineering department. In this study, Zheleva is analyzing large-scale longitudinal patient data to figure out which personalized interventions can optimize health outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, if a person quits or cuts down on smoking, that can lead to a significant decrease in medical costs. Individuals’ attributes, such as their genetics, environment, and pre-existing conditions, can amplify or diminish the causal effects of their smoking. Zheleva’s work will use causal inference methods to predict what the outcome would have been if a person who received treatment had received a different medical intervention instead.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>Since March 30, UIC faculty members have shifted their in-person courses to remote learning due to COVID-19. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what the experience has been like for a few of UIC&#8217;s faculty members: </p>



<h4><strong>Virginia Reising, UIC Nursing</strong></h4>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Prior to COVID-19, my class was hosted weekly in person. We have had to move our in-person classes online while still maintaining open discussion and case study as methods of learning. Utilizing the Zoom breakout rooms has been really helpful in letting students engage with each other in small groups.&nbsp;<br>The clinical portion of the course has moved online as well, and while I have tried to create learning experiences that mimic those the students would have had in person, it will, of course, be a different learning experience. To supplement their learning, we have created opportunities for them to simulate being with patients by hosting online simulation with actors serving in the role of patient. This allows the students to continue practicing their therapeutic communication and assessment skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>I have been so impressed with the student&#8217;s commitment to continued learning during what is a stressful and intense time for all. Students continue to show up to the online class time on time, prepared and ready to engage. This model of learning forces students to take ownership of the learning experience.&nbsp;<br>We start each session with a general check-in and students are given a chance to share how things are going in their lives. I have been surprised by how eager some students are to share their successes and challenges. These online sessions remind me that while we are physically distanced, the need for social connection has not disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>I have had to re-invent myself as a teacher, re-casting into a different mold. I have spent three decades working on being effective face-to-face, but online is different.&nbsp;I have been working hard to provide the same interactive peer-instruction practices that many students find useful.&nbsp;I still use clickers, but they are web clickers.&nbsp;I still have groups of three or four students briefly talk in small groups, but they are now all separate Google Meet groups.&nbsp;I still have students collaborate and compare answers with other groups, but now the comparison takes place online in a shared Google Slides document that the whole class edits together, with each small group having their own page where they collaborate on questions, answers and show their work.<br>Knowing how tiring it can be to listen to poor audio and watch grainy video, I&#8217;ve invested in a headset mic, a nicer webcam and lights to minimize poor communication due to equipment issues. Office hours are online.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going? </strong><br>OK, though it greatly increases the burden on students to be active in their engagement with learning. In class, there is social pressure to participate, but at home with the webcam off, each student needs to work harder to get the same level of engagement. Staring at a screen all day and listening to compressed audio online is fatiguing, both for me and for my students.</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Some classes are easier to move online than others, but in general, I’ve tried to maintain consistency and rigor as I would with a traditional semester. I hope this helps us to focus and take our minds off of the ongoing pandemic. Notably though, all of my lectures are still given live, but now recorded and through BB collaborate.&nbsp;For teaming classes, we’ve migrated all communications to webconference software to help ensure we still work together cohesively.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>Remote classes are a challenge in many ways.&nbsp;I think focusing is hard when you use your home for&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;(work, school, relaxation, eating, sleeping) and that’s a challenge for us all. These remote classes also make it hard for me to read the room — I’m delivering technical content to a blank screen with no faces and feedback is minimal.&nbsp;However, I am consistently surprised by the tenacity and adaptability of our students to the pandemic — their grit and dedication is really inspiring!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Since I completed the Illinois Online Network certificate program at our sister school in Springfield in 2012, I have developed courses since then to move from face to face to online in short order. I am fortunate I had great training and have been teaching online, hybrid and face-to-face courses regularly. Recently, I needed to learn how to make better instructional videos, learn new software, use different technologies and make sure I over-communicated with my students. My teaching network expanded to include colleagues outside UIC who make human resources and training and education videos for corporate clients.&nbsp;I have been able to share what I learned with my colleagues because of our department’s commitment to teaching.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>I feel satisfied with how things are going; I think students have shown remarkable resilience and adapted well in spite of barriers like access, hardware and bandwidth issues. I observed many colleagues make huge strides in a short time, often working 12-18 hour days to learn, adapt and implement remote learning.&nbsp;I feel given we are essentially providing emergency remote learning, we are doing very well. No doubt things have been difficult for some more than others, but nobody can doubt the commitment of UIC educators, administrators and most importantly students to making the best of a special situation nobody asked for.</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to your courses to move them online</strong>?<br>Weekly lectures have been “live” via Zoom with use of narrated Powerpoints as needed.&nbsp;Emails to and from students have been plentiful. Additional “group” projects that were supposed to be presented live are now being displayed via Blackboard Discussion Board posting, almost like a blog, to promote student engagement. Exams have been given remotely using Examsoft software, which thankfully was in place earlier in the semester!</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>In general, students and faculty have been flexible, which has been key to success.&nbsp;I miss seeing my students in lecture live; however, given the unprecedented times, I think we are doing the best we can! I have made sure to streamline assignments and students have appreciated extensions and flexibility on due dates!</p>

				<description><![CDATA[As we continue to adjust to distance instruction during the [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">As we continue to adjust to distance instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic, we write to affirm that instructors have a responsibility to support students with disabilities at the end of the term. It is imperative for faculty, especially for final exams, to implement accommodations such as academic adjustments, auxiliary aids and services.</p>
<p>We write to share, there are a number of resources available to support faculty as they determine how best to adapt their assessment strategies for accessible online instruction <a href="https://drc.uic.edu/faculty-resources-for-making-online-course-content-accessible/">here</a>. We’ve collected a curated list of best practices to guide instructors through considering what kinds of final assessments will be most effective.</p>
<p>Academic Computing and Communication Center (ACCC) has created a list of tips when creating and implementing online exams which can be found <a href="https://answers.uillinois.edu/uic/83651">here</a>. Upholding academic integrity has also been a concern for faculty. Some ways to combat academic dishonesty can be found at this <a href="https://answers.uillinois.edu/uic/75131">link</a>. Faculty can also create a set of statements attesting to academic integrity for their students to acknowledge before beginning an online/take-home exam.</p>
<p>For students that have testing accommodations, the following links may be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.5X or 2X <a href="https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Instructor/Tests_Pools_Surveys/Test_and_Survey_Options#test-availability-exceptions_OTP-4">extended time</a></li>
<li><a href="https://answers.uillinois.edu/uic/83682">Timed breaks</a>&nbsp;or you may manually add up the allowed break minutes per hour to the overall testing time</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that testing policies for DRC students still apply. Students should not miss other classes due to their extended time. In this case, alternate plans must be made and agreed upon by both the student and professor while ensuring testing accommodations are met.&nbsp;If you have any questions about testing accommodations, please contact the DRC at <a href="mailto:accesstesting@uic.edu">accesstesting@uic.edu</a> or contact the assigned Disability Specialist.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Disability Cultural Center has compiled a document supporting those most&nbsp;affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including resources about accessible online&nbsp;teaching practices. Many of these resources are focused on general best practices for accessibility, and may be useful for faculty who are preparing to teach online during the summer sessions. Particularly relevant for final exams, there is a new section that compiles a number of assessment alternatives to time-based testing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lT5sG4IgqzaLUacLbs--Q8mCJbS6RRa6jSl1LqWuFpI/edit">here</a>.</p>
<p>We thank you in advance for the work you do and for the role you play in supporting students with disabilities. We hope that these resources strengthen your efforts.</p>

<ul>
<li>The summer U-PASS will be active from June 1-August 12.</li>
<li>The deadline to OPT-IN for the summer U-PASS is May 10 at midnight CDT. After the deadline, the opt-status cannot be changed.</li>
<li>If there is a change in your credit hours prior to June 1, it may impact your ability to participate.</li>
<li><strong>All students are opted-out by default unless otherwise specified by the student.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To opt-in to the Summer 2020 U-PASS program, visit the website below where you’ll be asked to confirm and provide a shipping address to receive your new U-PASS. For students with existing U-PASS cards, the standard policies on lost/replacement cards will still be enforced.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty, In the wake of the [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty,</p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an alarming increase in discriminatory incidents directed at Asians and Asian Americans across this country and across the world. The labeling of COVID-19 as the “Wuhan Virus” and the wide circulation of derogatory social media memes can have harmful consequences for Asians and Asian Americans everywhere and devalue the many contributions they have made to this country for centuries.</p>
<p>So in addition to worrying about the health and well-being of their families and the impact of this pandemic on their work and personal lives, as we all are, members of Asian and Asian American communities, including UIC’s own community, have been experiencing discriminatory acts ranging from name-calling and bullying to physical attacks.</p>
<p>At UIC, we have a long history of working very closely with the many Asian American communities of Chicago and we are very proud to count a large number of Asian and Asian American students and alumni in our ranks. It goes without saying that we denounce these xenophobic practices and rhetoric, which are antithetical to our ethos and culture, and we will not tolerate any form of harassment against Asian and Asian American students, faculty and staff. We recognize that members of our own community may be experiencing such ostracism and violence and that this may be impacting their mental health and well-being. We want you to know that we are here to support you.</p>
<p>Campus units that can provide support include the <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/">Global Asian Studies Program</a>, the <a href="https://aarcc.uic.edu/">Asian American Resource and Cultural Center</a>, the <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/">Office of the Dean of Students</a> and the <a href="https://www.ois.uic.edu/">Office of International Services</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a member of our UIC community who has experienced any form of prejudice, discrimination, or harassment on or off campus and would like to report it, please fill out this <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofIllinoisChicago&amp;layout_id=24">online form</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the history of xenophobia and racism towards Asians and Asian Americans, you can find <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/career-and-resources/teaching-against-racism/">educational resources online</a>.</p>
<p>We are, indeed, all in this together and we ask everyone to take extra care during this time to support each other so that we will emerge from this extraordinary period as an even stronger and more compassionate community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Amiridis<br />
