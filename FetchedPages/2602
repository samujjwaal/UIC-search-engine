								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty,</p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an alarming increase in discriminatory incidents directed at Asians and Asian Americans across this country and across the world. The labeling of COVID-19 as the “Wuhan Virus” and the wide circulation of derogatory social media memes can have harmful consequences for Asians and Asian Americans everywhere and devalue the many contributions they have made to this country for centuries.</p>
<p>So in addition to worrying about the health and well-being of their families and the impact of this pandemic on their work and personal lives, as we all are, members of Asian and Asian American communities, including UIC’s own community, have been experiencing discriminatory acts ranging from name-calling and bullying to physical attacks.</p>
<p>At UIC, we have a long history of working very closely with the many Asian American communities of Chicago and we are very proud to count a large number of Asian and Asian American students and alumni in our ranks. It goes without saying that we denounce these xenophobic practices and rhetoric, which are antithetical to our ethos and culture, and we will not tolerate any form of harassment against Asian and Asian American students, faculty and staff. We recognize that members of our own community may be experiencing such ostracism and violence and that this may be impacting their mental health and well-being. We want you to know that we are here to support you.</p>
<p>Campus units that can provide support include the <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/">Global Asian Studies Program</a>, the <a href="https://aarcc.uic.edu/">Asian American Resource and Cultural Center</a>, the <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/">Office of the Dean of Students</a> and the <a href="https://www.ois.uic.edu/">Office of International Services</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a member of our UIC community who has experienced any form of prejudice, discrimination, or harassment on or off campus and would like to report it, please fill out this <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofIllinoisChicago&amp;layout_id=24">online form</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the history of xenophobia and racism towards Asians and Asian Americans, you can find <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/career-and-resources/teaching-against-racism/">educational resources online</a>.</p>
<p>We are, indeed, all in this together and we ask everyone to take extra care during this time to support each other so that we will emerge from this extraordinary period as an even stronger and more compassionate community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

<p>UI Health Mile Square Health Center — a network of federally qualified health centers, or FQHCs, in Chicago — is now providing COVID-19 testing to community members on the South Side who meet testing criteria at its South Shore clinic, located at 7037 S. Stony Island Ave. </p>



<p>Previously, only established or new Mile Square patients with symptoms were able to get a test. Now, any person in the community who meets testing criteria, such as having symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea, can make an appointment to get tested. Test results will be available in one to two days. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to respond to the needs of the South Shore community and to play an active role in addressing COVID-19 disparities,&#8221; said Dr. Ian Jasenof, chief medical officer of UI Health Mile Square Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mile Square has a long history of bringing health care to communities regardless of individuals&#8217; income, insurance status or ability to pay for care — expanding our COVID-19 testing capacity on Chicago&#8217;s South Side is an extension of our promise to put the health and well-being of all communities at the center of all we do,&#8221; said Henry Taylor, executive director of the UI Health Mile Square network.</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic began testing a limited number of patients today but will test patients by appointment, 10 a.m to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, starting tomorrow. The clinic is prepared to provide up to 30 tests a day. </p>



<p>As part of its expanded testing program, Mile Square has formalized a home monitoring program for individuals who test positive. </p>



<p>&#8220;Follow up and monitoring COVID-19 progression is just
as important as testing,&#8221; Jasenof said. &#8220;We still do not know why some
people with COVID-19 have mild illness while others have severe and
life-threatening illness. This monitoring process was developed to make sure
that if people do become severely ill, they have resources in place to get help
quickly.&#8221; </p>



<p>The South Shore clinic occupies space owned and operated by the Chicago Child Care Society, in Chicago&#8217;s 5th Ward.</p>



<p>“I welcome Mile Square’s capacity to start testing in Shore Shore, which is one of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. While 30 tests per day are a good first start, I hope the staff will have the resources to increase the number of daily tests,” said 5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston. “We know the key to flattening the curve is treatment, testing and tracking.”</p>



<p>Dara Munson, CEO of the Chicago Childcare Society, said, “Chicago Child Care Society has a long-standing commitment to the South Shore neighborhood and is a proud partner with UI Mile Square Health Center.&nbsp;We are saddened but not surprised by the disparities that COVID-19 is illuminating. CCCS is committed to doing our part to serve this and all communities during this pandemic and beyond.”</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic is the third official testing site in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System. The UI Health Mile Square drive-up testing center, located at 1220 S. Wood St., tested its first patient on March 25, and the Pilsen COVID-19 evaluation clinic, located at 1713 S. Ashland Ave., began evaluating and testing patients on March 30. </p>



<p>Combined, these three UI Health testing centers can process around
150 tests each day. </p>



<p>At this time, all testing centers are by appointment only and only for patients who meet testing criteria.</p>



<p>Patients should call 866-600-2273 to speak with a nurse to make an appointment or visit <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-triage">hospital.uillinois.edu</a> for more information. </p>



<p>Mile Square plans to expand its COVID-19 testing program to other locations as well. Next up is its clinic in Cicero, located at 4745–51 W. Cermak Road. Testing at this clinic is expected to start in early May. </p>

<p>The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, has awarded $8 million over four years to the University of Illinois at Chicago to lead a multisite, interdisciplinary center focused on research, training and technique development in the study of materials in extreme conditions. </p>



<p>As part of the NNSA&#8217;s Stewardship Science Academic Alliances program, UIC will manage the Chicago/DOE Alliance Center, or CDAC, a Center of Excellence for High Pressure Science and Technology led by Russell Hemley, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Distinguished Chair in the Natural Sciences and professor of physics and chemistry at UIC.</p>



<p>“The center will continue to increase the visibility of NNSA science and UIC’s leading research to the broader U.S. academic community. We are pleased by UIC’s commitment to the center and excited by the proximity of its headquarters to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, with which CDAC partners for research and training, ” said Hemley, who has long been engaged in forefront developments in high-pressure physics, chemistry and materials science.</p>



<p>The center, which had been headquartered in Washington, D.C., since 2003, will continue its coordinated education and outreach program. The program exposes graduate students to extreme conditions science through training at CDAC laboratories and facilitating interactions between NNSA laboratory scientists and academic groups.</p>



<p>CDAC will lead research and training in a broad range of studies of the behavior of materials at various pressures and temperatures, including crystalline solids, fluids and glasses, nanostructured to mesostructured materials, and complex composites.</p>



<p>“This work will expand the boundaries of knowledge in
materials and high pressure science, while also developing the next generation
of scientists to support the stockpile stewardship mission,” said Mark
Anderson, assistant deputy administrator for research, development, test and
evaluation in NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Launched in 2002, the Stewardship Science Academic Alliances program supports areas of fundamental research and development relevant to NNSA’s stockpile stewardship mission and helps recruit the next generation of highly trained scientists and engineers for the Nuclear Security Enterprise.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Additional UIC-affiliated staff involved includes research professors Stephen Gramsch, CDAC deputy director, and Muhtar Ahart, Ravhi Kumar and Zhenxian Liu. External academic partners include researchers from Michigan State University, Northwestern University, University of Buffalo, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Tennessee and University of Utah. </p>

<p>There’s growing concern for the homeless community since COVID-19 arrived in Chicago.</p>



<p>That’s why various nonprofits, shelters, city and health care leaders have come together to address the problems those experiencing homelessness are facing while protecting public health.</p>



<p>The Unsheltered Chicago Coalition, formerly known as the Westside COVID Response Team, is brainstorming ways to prevent or mitigate COVID outbreaks in the city&#8217;s shelters, where some of the most medically vulnerable live in crowded open areas, prone to be cluster sites. Each day, the team hosts two conference calls with community leaders, city government and providers.</p>



<p>UIC’s Dr. Stockton Mayer said the intent of the response team is to “advocate for an appropriate population-specific response” to COVID-19 in the city’s homeless population.</p>



<p>“I joined the group because many of our clients at the Community Outreach Intervention Projects (School of Public Health) experience homelessness,” said Mayer, assistant professor of clinical medicine in the College of Medicine. “We didn’t feel we had a solution for how to best serve them as providers.”</p>



<p><strong>Pulling from city&#8217;s resources</strong></p>



<p>The Unsheltered Chicago Coalition is a collaboration between some of the city’s health providers — Rush University Medical Center, UI Health, Cook County Health, Lawndale Christian Health Center, Salvation Army and Heartland Alliance in particular.</p>



<p>Mayer co-leads the testing team at multiple shelters in the city.&nbsp; The team responds to outbreaks at shelters throughout the city.&nbsp;In addition to testing, they offer infection control support, personal protective equipment or PPEs, and provider support.</p>



<p>“Pacific Garden Mission was one of the first shelters where we tested broadly,” he said. “However, we’ve tested over 1,000 citizens in the last two weeks.”</p>



<p>Mayer and UIC infectious disease chief Dr. Richard Novak also are guiding development of screening and point of care testing in Westside crisis shelters. Another UIC doctor on the team has developed infection control guidelines for the shelters to follow.</p>



<p>A big concern right now, Mayer said, is finding housing solutions for those who recover from COVID-19.</p>



<p>Dr. Evelyn Figueroa, professor of clinical family medicine, family medicine residency program director and community activist, developed an emergency COVID response team for Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago&#8217;s largest homeless shelter. Through that operation, the first and largest homeless shelter COVID isolation unit was opened on April 10 and has provided infirmary-level care for over 160 individuals experiencing homelessness. The PGM Emergency COVID Medical Response Team is composed of family medicine residents, medical students, registered nurses, and additional clinicians from UI Health, Rush Medical Center and Lawndale Christian Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tens of thousands of adults and children are living with unstable housing. The infection control aspects of COVID (hand hygiene, masking, social distancing, education) present significant challenges to people experiencing homelessness,&#8221; Figueroa said. &#8220;Public go-to places for sink bathing and phone charging are closed due to the stay-at-home order. By recognizing and addressing the unique medical and social challenges that homeless shelters face, we have successfully provided both COVID-related care as well as primary care, medication-assisted treatment and social services.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stephen Brown, UI Health director of preventive emergency medicine, plays a logistical role. In a community with resources already stretched thin, he was recently able to work with colleagues at Cook County Health to mine data sources and assemble a list that identified 425 congregate living facilities — places typically for residents 55 years of age or older —to help as many people as they can.</p>



<p>Centene, the largest Medicaid insurance carrier in the state, approached Brown last week. After a brief video conference, Centene’s team donated 100,000 masks and $150,000.</p>



<p>Brown has built relationships over several years with law enforcement, EMS, mental health, substance use and city agencies.</p>



<p>“I listen to the calls and connect in resources that will be useful to the team,” he said. “At the moment, I am lining up de-escalation training for shelter staff for those patients with serious mental illness that may be decompensating.”</p>



<p><strong>Keeping people informed</strong></p>

<p>While the Unsheltered Chicago Coalition is acting as a citywide resource hub, a group of UIC students has joined forces to support Stockton’s team if needed during the pandemic. They are on the ground doing screenings, supporting community-based testing, supporting staff testing, and calling on local organizations to identify their needs.</p>



<p>The organization, called COVID Rapid Response Team Chicago, or COVID RRT Chicago, has more than 250 UIC volunteers accepting requests for help. The volunteers include graduate and undergraduate students in medicine, nursing, applied psychology, and physical and occupational therapy.</p>



<p>The team provides daily symptom screenings at shelters to help track spread of COVID-19 and to protect the guests. They have implemented ‘shelter support days,’ which includes medication packaging, preparing supplies, and providing enrichment activities to the guests, including informational health sessions and interactive/creative activities. Right now, Pacific Garden Mission is the focus of their screenings.</p>



<p>”This is why I&#8217;m in medicine,” said co-organizer Sofia Sami, a new medical school graduate of UIC. “This moment is going to leave a huge impact on Chicago and many people globally. It will and should force us to think of community medicine, organized medicine, social medicine, and our lack of public health infrastructure.</p>



<p>As lead strategist for the group, Sami supports Dr. Mayer&#8217;s team with rapid testing in shelter sites, and throughout the day, participates on different partner project calls working to carve out opportunities for support — at UI Health and broadly in the community.</p>



<p>The group has created a volunteer training manual that outlines safety precautions, PPE and screening protocols that have been approved by physicians who are working with them to provide the screenings.</p>



<p>“We are the future of health care. We have dedicated our life’s work to improving the health and well-being of the population, yet there is no clear role for us in the response to the COVID pandemic,” said co-organizer Taylor Vandenberg, a first-year medical student at UIC.  </p>



<p>Vandenberg said being a medical student right now is a very emotionally charged experience that many are struggling to cope with.</p>



<p>“I wanted to use my understanding of health and medicine to fill in the gaps that our health care providers cannot always reach due to overwhelming need in hospitals and clinics,” she said. “Those realizations led me to this work, helping to protect the health and well-being of a very vulnerable population, which I have found to be a highly valuable experience.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, Vandenberg said, choosing how to respond to this pandemic is a very complex and personal decision.</p>



<p>“Whatever you are doing, whether it be active volunteering, remote volunteering/research, or simply abiding by the shelter-in-place policy and taking care of yourself, there is no right or wrong approach,” she said.</p>



<p>Other schools participating in the COVID RRT Chicago include Northwestern University, Rush University, University of Chicago, Loyola, and Rosalind Franklin University in North Chicago.</p>

<p>University of Illinois at Chicago was selected by the state to produce 160,000 vials of Virus Transport Medium (VTM) — a crucial testing material for COVID-19 — and make them available to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Currently, there is a shortage of VTM throughout the nation as the demand for COVID-19 tests continues to increase. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was contacted by the Governor’s office and asked whether UIC could help out,” said Bellur Prabhakar, UIC professor of microbiology and immunology and senior associate dean for research in the College of Medicine. “Given UIC’s commitment to fighting COVID-19 pandemic and our earlier experience with SARS, it was an easy decision.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prabhakar’s work has been <a href="https://today.uic.edu/inventor-of-the-year-bellur-s-prabhakar">recognized</a> for developing therapeutic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.706">monoclonal antibodies</a> against SARS and identifying <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/8/4353">antiviral molecules</a> to make SARS vaccines more effective. </p>



<p>UIC started production of the VTM last week.</p>



<p>“Although we have been given 6 to 8 weeks to fill the order, we fully expect to deliver all 160,000 vials to the state well before the end of this month,” Prabhakar said. </p>



<p>Prabhakar and colleagues gathered the four required materials to create the VTM from across the country quickly — in less than three days. Once the VTM is made and sterilized, they also perform quality control to ensure the absence of any microorganisms. </p>



<p>VTM is a critical component for COVID-19 testing. A nasal swab is placed in the VTM to prevent degradation of COVID-19 that may be present in patients’ samples. This gives the state up to a week for shipping and testing.</p>



<p>Also involved in this project are UIC&#8217;s Prabhakaran Kumar and Stefan Green of UIC and volunteers from the UIC Research Resource Center and College of Medicine.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>We know this spring has been difficult for UIC students. We are sending a student survey to students&#8217; UIC email addresses to check in and see how you are doing, and to give you the opportunity to tell us what is working and what is not working. The results of this survey will help us evaluate our activities this semester as well as develop plans for the future.</p>



<p>Your participation in this survey is voluntary. There are no penalties if you decide not to participate or if you choose to skip any questions. The survey is short and should take less than ten minutes to complete. Your responses to the survey are confidential. Your individual responses will not be reported to anyone. Reports and findings will only include aggregate data and small groupings of data will be suppressed to avoid the possibility of attributing survey responses to an individual student. </p>



<p>If you have problems linking to and completing the survey, please contact Anna Pasillas-Santoyo, Associate Director of Institutional Research, at apasil1@uic.edu for assistance.</p>



<p>We would appreciate hearing from you so we can get a better sense of how you are doing and ways that we can improve your experience as a student at UIC during this crisis period. We know this is a busy time for you and we really appreciate your attention to this survey.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Identifying inhibitors could lead to new medicines to combat the coronavirus]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/SARS-CoV-2.kral_.han_.gif" alt="Computational design of ACE2-based peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2" class="wp-image-93621"/><figcaption> Computational design of ACE2-based peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

<p>SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic,
infects cells by using its spike proteins to attach to proteins present on the
surfaces of certain human cells, also known as ACE2 receptors. Upon binding to
ACE2, the virus fuses with the host cell membrane and gains entry via this
attachment.</p>



<p>Finding inhibitors that block key regions of the spike protein and
keep the virus from infecting cells is the focus of many scientists from around
world.</p>



<p>At the University of Illinois at Chicago, researchers recently published a study in the journal <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.0c02857">ACS Nano</a> that details findings from computer simulations seeking to identify these inhibitors, which eventually could assist chemists to develop new medicines to combat the coronavirus.</p>



<p>Using a recently published X-ray crystal structure of the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 when it is bound to ACE2, the researchers
were able to identify 15 amino acids from ACE2 that interact directly with the
viral spike protein.</p>



<p>Yanxiao Han, a UIC Ph.D. student in chemistry and first author on the paper, and Petr Král, UIC professor of chemistry, physics, biopharmaceutical sciences and chemical engineering, used computer modeling to design and assess four peptides that mimic the virus-binding domain of the human protein that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. </p>



<p>Their molecular dynamics simulations revealed a double alpha helix
extracted from ACE2 as a highly stable peptide and potential defender from the
virus, capable of blocking the spike proteins.</p>



<p>“A single alpha helix was not particularly stable,” said Král, senior author of the study. “So, the discovery that a pair of linked self-supporting helices can provide strong and stable binding was very exciting.”</p>



<p>Han and Král hope that simple peptides might do the job of
healing the patients in later stages by slowing down the activity of the virus.
</p>



<p>“Such peptides might have limited secondary impact on the
organisms,” Král said. “These are not vaccines but possible therapeutics for
inhalation.”</p>



<p>The peptides still need to be tested in the lab and in patients, but being able to narrow down drug candidates on the computer could help advance this process, according to the researchers. </p>



<p>Han’s work related to the study is supported through the UIC
Graduate College Dean’s Scholar Fellowship.</p>
