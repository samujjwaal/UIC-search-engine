<p><strong>By David Staudacher</strong></p>
<p>Being an active member of a student organization has many benefits, including scholarship opportunities. Students from UIC’s Civil and Materials Engineering dominated the Illinois section of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) scholarships. The UIC students were awarded five of only 12 scholarships allocated.</p>
<p><strong>ASCE Student Leadership &amp; Involvement Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Cleo Jaurigue was awarded the ASCE Student Leadership &amp; Involvement Scholarship for her active leadership role in the ASCE student chapter where she is the fundraising chair.</p>
<p>“I was really surprised. With everything going on right now, I almost forgot about it. It was definitely a good surprise,” she said.</p>
<p>As a UIC student, she was previously awarded a Civil Engineering Professional Advisory Committee (CEPAC) scholarship from Turner Construction, which is geared specifically toward CME students.</p>
<p>Joseph Schulenberg, assistant clinical professor of CME, recommended Jaurigue for her great attitude, work ethic, and strong interest in learning the field of civil engineering.</p>
<p>“Cleo has a strong military background, and her training there has given her a great deal of discipline to permit her to succeed academically,” said Schulenberg. “Additionally, she has a strong service ethic. She has volunteered to describe her engineering experiences to prospective students, volunteered with the American Society of Civil Engineers as fundraising chair and webmaster. She has worked with the Freshman Success Program to help freshmen make the transition to college.”</p>
<p><strong>Transportation &amp; Development Institute Bob Camillone Memorial Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Natasha Breslieva and Ines Torra-Bilal were the recipients of the Transportation &amp; Development Institute Bob Camillone Memorial Scholarship for taking relevant elective courses or indicating strong interest in transportation engineering, drainage, urban planning, structural engineering, or geotechnical engineering.</p>
<p>“As a future transportation engineer, I was thrilled to be elected for the T&amp;DI scholarship. During times of pandemic, winning scholarships is what keeps us going and motivated to do even better in the future,” said Breslieva, who serves as the fundraising chair for the UIC chapter of ASCE.</p>
<p>As a UIC student, she has also won the Gordon Paesani ITS Midwest Scholarship and the ASCE – UESI Pipelines Conference Student Scholarship, and she earned two other scholarships before transferring to UIC.</p>
<p>“Natasha showed great academic curiosity in my class and was always attentive. I was impressed with her solid engineering skills, quick grasp of fundamental concepts, and ability to apply in real engineering problems, demonstrated through her class project. This is reflected in a number of real-world professional experiences Natasha has had in the five years,” said Jane Lin, a CME professor and director of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/uic.edu/sustrans/home">SusTrans Lab</a> who recommended her for the scholarship.</p>
<p>“I am sincerely honored to have been selected as the recipient of this prestigious award. This great achievement is very motivating and meaningful to me as I am working towards completing my doctoral research under UIC’s Associate Professor Mustafa Mahamid,” said Torra-Bilal. “I would like to truly thank my advisor for his continuous support and for always being an excellent mentor and role model for me.”</p>
<p>During her tenure at UIC, she won a scholarship in the Christopher Burke Poster Competition for PhD students in 2019 and Illinois Society of Professional Engineers award in 2017.</p>
<p>Her success is echoed by her supervising professor Mahamid, who recommended her for the scholarship.</p>
<p>“She has the ability to apply her knowledge in different fields which will significantly benefit her in the future as an engineer and possibly as a researcher, and has published several journal and conference papers so far and she is currently working on various topics,” he said. “She is very well-rounded student and strives to make a difference in her community through volunteering, takes advantage of any opportunity she has to help other students, and conducts herself in a very professional manner.”</p>
<p><strong>Structural Engineering Institute Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Michelle Calcagno picked up the Structural Engineering Institute Scholarship for taking relevant elective courses or indicating strong interest in structural engineering or architectural engineering.</p>
<p>“I was excited and appreciative because I will need it for Berkeley,” said Calcagno. “Chicago is a great city to be studying civil engineering in, after all, it is the home of the first skyscraper. I am proud to say that I physically helped build some of the skyscrapers that shape Chicago’s amazing skyline. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to attend UIC to learn how to design these structures that are visible from campus.”</p>
<p>As a UIC student, she also won the Illinois Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association Scholarship from the UIC College of Engineering.</p>
<p>Apart from taking courses, Calcagno went above and beyond as an ASCE member to support her fellow students.</p>
<p>“Michelle has been instrumental, and a key element, behind the success of the ASCE Legends initiative that was implemented – with the help of the ASCE – IL Section – for the first time in the history of the ASCE,” said Hossein Ataei, clinical assistant professor, and director of Undergraduate Studies in CME.</p>
<p>The ASCE Legends is a mentorship program that is specifically designed to further engage and involve retired civil engineers with younger members and students as professional mentors.</p>
<p>“Michelle is an excellent student; an absolutely hard-working individual with very high levels of integrity, involvement, and professionalism. She is driven, dedicated, and persistent in performing the assigned projects and professional/academic tasks,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental and Water Resources Institute Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Kyle Berry received the Environmental and Water Resources Institute Scholarship for taking relevant elective courses or indicating strong interest in environmental engineering or water resources engineering.</p>
<p>“I was ecstatic and thankful. I have never won a scholarship before and for it to come from a prestigious organization like ASCE made it even better,” he said. “The CME program at UIC provides so much opportunity in theChicagoland job market. I am grateful to be in such an exceptional program.”</p>
<p>Barry also served as the Student Events and Outreach Chair for the UIC student chapter of ASCE, and the team captain of the Student Steel Bridge Club for the ASCE Great Lakes Student Conference. He cited the experience as one of the most challenging projects at UIC, but was grateful to find the support needed to succeed.</p>
<p>“Eric Schmidt, director of the UIC Makerspace, is incredibly knowledge about manufacturing and equipment usage. He turns ideas that students have for projects into reality,” he said.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting daily life and systems around the world. Businesses, schools, municipalities, tourism and much more are being impacted as people scramble to keep operations going while keeping the public safe.</p>
<p>For Quintin Williams Jr., a clinical assistant professor in industrial engineering, this is familiar territory. Williams has been volunteering in Leogane, Haiti, to help the people who have experienced multiple disasters.</p>
<p>In 2010, an earthquake decimated Haiti. In 2016, Hurricane Matthew ravaged the Caribbean country with catastrophic flooding of up to 40 inches and a storm surge of up to 10 feet. The Category 5 hurricane, the first since Felix in 2007, claimed the lives of nearly 600 people, and more than 35,000 people were left homeless.</p>
<p>Williams partnered with Dr. Monique Germain, a faculty member in the nursing program at Chicago State University, and an organization called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MedGroup-Haiti-135850883627875/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel&amp;_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">MedGroup HAITI,</a> a non-governmental, apolitical, non-profit organization founded by several health professionals, after identifying a set of health problems ravaging the Haitian population.</p>
<p>“I’m helping to improve health outcomes through free health screening, life skills and disaster training, and I’m working with the engineers who are building structures,” he said. “Hundreds of disadvantaged villagers have been vaccinated, given free medicines, and aided with homebuilding.”</p>
<p>“I work directly with sanitation and trying to engineer a process for recycling and structure building. We worked on re-engineering and improving sanitation methods of the villages, and integrating environmental and occupational safety public health education into the nursing curriculum at the university,” he added.</p>
<p>Along with helping the people of Haiti, Williams is using the real-world experience and research with his industrial engineering students at UIC. He’s been able to connect his experience to independent study research with some students and present it at global health conferences.</p>
<p>“I use this in classes where we talk about structure and safety engineering, when we talk about the laws that govern the way things are built,” he said. “In this case, Haiti doesn’t have the same structure. It’s a good example of how the U.S. system of operation building codes are logistically necessary when it comes to having structures that can survive those natural disasters.”</p>
<p>While the professor is using the experience in his courses, he originally got involved because he “is inclined toward helping those who can’t help themselves.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been fascinated with Haiti,” said Williams. “I always wondered how it was possible to live in a community where the average person lives off less than one dollar a day. To experience abject poverty and still be around people who are humble and helpful to each other, to have that type of community spirit, and to be a position where you don’t have resources, it was a game changer for me. Instead of just looking at the brick and mortar institutions there, but to have a true grassroots community-based program was a phenomenal opportunity. I couldn’t pass that up.”</p>

<p>Laxman Saggere, professor of mechanical and industrial engineering (MIE), died April 27, 2020, after a long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Saggere joined the MIE department in 2001 as an assistant professor with a courtesy appointment in bioengineering. He was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 2007. He was the director of the Saggere Lab, where he researched the fundamental and applied aspects of microsystems (MEMS) and nanoengineering. He sought to develop innovative biomimetic and bioinspired microsystems for unmet needs in biomedical, micro- and nanomanufacturing and other areas with an interdisciplinary approach, which include mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, MEMS technology, and neuroscience.</p>
<p>His notable honors include the NIH Trailblazer Award from the National Institutes of Health in 2019; best paper awards from the ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition; ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences in 2011, 2009, and 2004; the Faculty Research Award from the UIC College of Engineering in 2009 and 2006; and the prestigious CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation in 2005.</p>
<p>Based on his achievements as a researcher and his quality as a person, Saggere was respected and liked by colleagues<strong>,</strong> staff members, and students, many of whom spoke highly of him during a recent online memorial.</p>
<p>“It’s never easy to lose someone you know,” said Farzad Mashayek, head of the MIE department. “It’s even more difficult to lose someone whom you worked with so closely and relied upon. I truly believe that Laxman was one of the most devoted and consequential members of this department. There’s no doubt that he will be missed.”</p>
<p>“Laxman was an exceptional person,” said Carmen M. Lilley, associate professor in the MIE department. “He was more than a great researcher and colleague. He also had deep empathy and was a truly kind person.</p>
<p>“My start as an academic was a tough one,” she continued, “and Laxman understood the challenges I was experiencing. He freely offered his support and was generous with his time. I knew I could always count on getting his feedback on my proposals and research. He would also always offer sage advice when I asked him for his opinion. I will deeply miss his friendship in the department and I send my deepest condolences to his wife, Neelam.”</p>
<p>In addition to Mashayek and Saggere&#8217;s wife, Neelam Taneja, the online memorial was attended by current and former members of the department community, as well as Saggere’s former Ph.D. advisor, Professor Sridhar Kota of the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and one of his former lab mates from graduate school, Professor Gondi Ananthasuresh of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.</p>
<p>The speakers praised him for his achievements, strong work ethic, attention to detail, and his dedication to the department, students, faculty, and the university. They especially celebrated him as a wonderful and caring person.</p>

<p>MIE Ph.D. candidate Rukmava Chatterjee has won several awards at UIC, and the prolific student just secured another one. Chatterjee was named the winner of the Award for Graduate Research (AGR) for the project, “Exceptional anti-ice and anti-frost performance of multifunctional phase change materials.”</p>
<p>The award is the Graduate College’s longest-running support for research by graduate students at UIC. It is designed to allow students to take advantage of unique opportunities to further their research, and to aid progress toward their degrees.</p>
<p>“We are all facing personal and professional challenges due to the current worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst such circumstances, getting recognized for my PhD research by means of the AGR has delighted and motivated me,” said Rukmava Chatterjee, who works under the direction of Assistant Professor Sushant Anand in the <a href="https://anand.lab.uic.edu/">Laboratory for Engineering Surface Dynamics</a> at UIC.</p>
<p>His research is focused on using certain phase change materials in the form of spray-on anti-icing solutions for real life applications in cold weather. He has formulated a wide library of multi-functional anti-icing coatings with varying viscosities which can be easily painted on any industrially relevant surface. The research has the potential to significantly impact multiple industries including, airlines, power transmission, wind power, HVAC, and automobile.</p>
<p>The student’s success is rooted in a supportive environment where he has the opportunity to be creative and receive the backing he requires.</p>
<p>“Professor Anand has been extremely supportive of my research activities by providing constant academic guidance, necessary research infrastructure, and the opportunity to explore a wide-variety of interesting projects as a part of my doctoral dissertation. I am also thankful to my labmates Dr. Hassan Bararnia and Umesh Chaudhuri, who helped me in this project,” he said.</p>
<p>His success is applauded by Anand, and the professor speaks highly of his student.</p>
<p>“I have come to appreciate him as a great student and person of remarkable character. The work done by Rukmava has been one of the mainstays of our lab and I am extremely proud of him,” said Anand. “A key characteristic I have come to learn and admire about him is that he works on hypothesis-driven research, and has the ability to break complex problems in to smaller subsets that are easier to deal with. He possesses the two fundamental qualities that are required for anyone to be successful in the field of academia — the tenacity to overcome stumbling blocks, and character to pursue truth. Rukmava is a gifted researcher and the extensive breadth of research he is performing during his doctoral studies shows this.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Chatterjee won the “UIC Graduate Student Council Travel Award” for presenting a conference paper at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers annual meeting. In 2019, he won first place in the “Pritzker Nanofabrication Facility Annual Nanofabrication Image Contest” by University of Chicago, second place in the “Image Of Research 2019” contest held by UIC, first place in “Water Photo Contest” by the American Chemical Society, “Best Oral Presentation Award” sponsored by Coatings and awarded by American Institute of Sciences for outstanding oral presentation at International Conference on Nature Inspired Surface Engineering, and the “Faydor Litvin Graduate Award” from the UIC Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department in recognition of academic achievement and service to the department and graduate student community.</p>

<p>On April 20, UIC Housing hosted an end of the year virtual ceremony to honor student staff, student leaders and other members of the housing team who have performed the meaningful work of campus community building.</p>
<p>Over 100 community members attended the virtual ceremony to celebrate and award those who have gone above and beyond in their work and commitment to UIC’s inclusive student culture.</p>
<p>Peers nominated award-winners with heartfelt narratives about their nominees and provided examples of how each person made Campus Housing a home for our residents. Some phrases heard were that they were “the most selfless person I have ever met” or “always enters every situation with a positive attitude, and her never-ending optimism is contagious.”</p>
<p>At the ceremony, each of the professional staff members on the Housing Residence Life team took their turns presenting awards and highlighting the student staff that they support every day.

been pouring in from a variety of sources.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>By Michael Wesbecher</strong></p>



<p>An outpouring of donations from UIC labs, community partners, grateful patients, students, staff and a vast alumni network spanning local neighborhoods and communities across the globe have supported UI Health&#8217;s COVID-19 relief efforts from the very beginning of the pandemic.</p>



<p>As UIC’s academic health enterprise, UI Health has been at the forefront of the COVID-19 response efforts through its <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-triage">adjustments of clinical programs, development of community testing sites</a>, <a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-clinical-trials-investigate-covid-19-treatments">clinical trials</a>, and <a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/uic-covid-19-public-health-response/">expert guidance to policy and advocacy experts</a>. As the nation and region began to see the virus spread, the extended university family mobilized to help. Nearly every dimension of UI Health&#8217;s academic health enterprise community raised their hand to lend assistance, through physical donations of personal protective equipment (PPE), sustaining gifts of meals for health care staff, and financial donations that have contributed to our clinical response. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Community organizations and groups teamed up to generously donate needed PPE to safeguard the health of both UI Health health care workers and patients alike. Collectively, these donations amounted to over 240,000 face masks (including more than 20,000 N95 respirators), over 45,000 articles of protective clothing, over 25,500 face shields and eye protection, nearly 700,000 gloves, over 5,600 cleaning supplies, more than 2,380 home-sewn cloth masks and over 7,100 meals for health care workers.</p>



<p>While research and simulation lab managers across the university were taking inventory of their protective equipment to share, College of Dentistry Dean Clark Stanford had his sights on mobilizing the dental community from across Chicago and the state. <a href="https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2020-archive/april/chicago-dental-society-donates-thousands-of-supplies-to-dental-school-clinic-health-care-facilities">Stanford reached out to the Chicago Dental Society</a> and the Illinois State Dental Society in anticipation of supply shortages to bring in more than 800 masks, 5,700 gloves and more than 4,000 gowns that were slated to be used for the rescheduled regional educational programming. </p>



<p>And that was just the start.&nbsp;In fact, the College of Dentistry stepped up to temporarily house the inventory of supplies streaming in from beyond the dental community — even globally. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Enrico Benedetti, head of the Department of Surgery and Warren H. Cole Chair in Surgery, as well as surgery residents, staff and community members, also saw the need for vital PPE, such as N94s and other face masks. Second-year general surgery resident Dr. Andy Lee and his wife, Susan Zhou, worked alongside administrator Arlin Aldaba to garner supply donations on social media. In all, these efforts produced over 25,000 PPE masks, including 12,000 K95 or N95 respirators and 20,000 surgical masks. </p>



<p>“We were aware how severe COVID-19 was in China and understood the importance of medical staff being protected by face masks,” Zhou said. “I was part of several social media groups in the Chinese American community that were looking to donate face masks to hospitals. That’s when I suggested that I could help them donate to our hospital.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Additionally, medical students took their own initiative to connect among their peers across the city to collect and distribute needed PPE to area hospitals. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/getmeppechi/home">#GetMePPE Chicago</a> was established through the grassroots effort of medical students to equitably distribute PPE donations to over 20 health care and community organizations, including UI Health, in need of protective equipment.</p>



<p>And yet, additional support for UI Health has poured in from many other motivated community organizations and individuals, including (though not limited to): </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-life-coronavirus-ipad-donation-uic-cubs-tt-20200424-3bnm3tmbqfdq7mwtsbarqy5ub4-story.html">Cubs Charities</a>&#8216; donation of 75 iPads to keep patients connected during visitor restrictions to the hospital;</li><li>Ford Motor Company (福特), Ford Motor China (福特中国) and Shanghai Public Diplomacy Association (上海公共外交协会) with 30,000 surgical masks;</li><li><a href="https://today.uic.edu/nursing-clinical-instructor-starts-fundraising-campaign-to-donate-cell-phone-chargers-to-hospital-patients">Megan Cairns Tress</a>, who raised funds to buy phone chargers for patients in Chicago-area hospitals — including 400 chargers for UI Health;</li><li>Chicago’s Vietnamese community and nail industry&#8217;s donation of PPE;</li><li>Home Depot Pro (IPHEC), which donated additional N95 masks</li><li>Smile Direct Club, which donated 500 face shields;</li><li>Beam Suntory, which donated 18 pallets of hand sanitizer;</li><li>Justin Chang Stauffer,  a student at Northside College Prep and son of a UI Health physician, who started a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/masks-and-protection-for-uic-medical-center?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet">GoFundMe page</a> offering virtual concerts for donations in support of PPE, and</li><li>Another <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ui-health-internal-medicine-residency?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1">GoFundMe page for Internal Medicine Residents</a> to support lunches and meals during their clinical commitments. </li></ul>



<p>Direct donations also have expanded to include the delivery of over 7,100 meals to sustain UI Health staff, and nearly $70,000 from 200 financial donors to the <a href="https://flamesfunded.uic.edu/?cfpage=project&amp;project_id=35471">COVID-19 Crisis Response and Healthcare Delivery Fund</a>. The generosity of individuals from across UIC, the University of Illinois System, and our local community has helped provide nourishing meals throughout the day to various shifts to allow for UI Health staff to continue to provide excellent patient care, stay healthy themselves and keep the public safe.</p>



<p>Most recently, as a <a href="https://nursing.uic.edu/news-stories/donors-help-college-celebrate-nurses-week/">show of appreciation to UI Health nurses and in recognition of National Nurses Week</a>, UIC College of Nursing Dean Terri Weaver, and donors Frank Naeymi-Rad, Dr. Theresa Kepic and Leap of Faith Technologies Inc. will provide 2,500 healthy, individually wrapped meals to nurses at the UI Hospital May 6-12.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For the first time in nearly a decade, several University of Illinois at Chicago students will be receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Education, or BFAAE, degree as well as a professional teaching license to be able to teach art in the K-12 grades.</p>



<p>The program began
anew in the fall of 2017 with a cohort of five students, three of whom will be
graduating with the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts in a virtual
ceremony on May 16. The graduating seniors include Edith
Mendez, Jennifer Gonzalez, and Latrell Walton.</p>



<p>Mendez recently was accepted into the Chicago Public Schools’ early offer program, which guarantees her a teaching position with the district for the 2020-21 school year. The next step is for her to interview with principals for placement in a specific school.</p>



<p>As part of their program, students had to take classes in the College of Education at UIC. In addition, they had to complete fieldwork and student teaching this past year. Like other teachers in Chicago, the student teachers experienced unprecedented challenges that will help make them better instructors, said Karyn Sandlos, who oversees the program. During this time, they were able to plan and teach, “amazing, personally and culturally relevant curricula and lesson plans.”</p>



<p>“They faced many challenges, including a Chicago Teachers Union strike in Fall 2019 and the closing of CPS in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Sandlos said. “Our students were able to turn these challenges into learning opportunities including learning what it means to teach under crisis conditions.”</p>



<p>Since its initial cohort of five students, the program has grown to 14, including the graduating seniors. Another 13 new students have applied to enter the major in the fall, for a total of 24 students. Students enter the program in the third year of their college career after they have fulfilled requirements in studio art, art history and general education.</p>



<p>As Sandlos began developing the program, she reached out to representatives from a local nonprofit, “<a href="http://www.growyourownteachers.org/">Grow Your Own Teachers Illinois</a>,” or GYO, whose focus is to diversify the teaching profession in the state. </p>



<p>“The group works closely with several other colleges but was eager to get more UIC students involved,” Sandlos said.</p>



<p>The organization has eight students from UIC’s BFA in Art Education program participating in the initiative where they receive financial, academic and social support in exchange for a five-year commitment to teach in a high-need public school after they graduate. The students, including the three graduates, can receive up to $25,000 in tuition assistance each during their lifetime.</p>



<p>Edith Mendez, who graduated from Morton West High School in Berwyn, Illinois, and is a sculptor and mixed-media artist, said the UIC program provided her with the tools to succeed in her new career.</p>



<p>“I was able to create a timeline with my professor to stay on track for student teaching, the edTPA, graduation, licensure and applying for jobs,” Mendez said. “This program is a tight-knitted community, and I always had access to my professors to address any questions, comments or concerns especially with the job application process.”</p>



<p>In the fall of 2019, the program expanded with the hire of William Estrada as a new faculty member in art education and studio art. The multidisciplinary artist and educator has taught at Telpochcalli Elementary School in Little Village for 18 years and has been a teaching artist since 1998.</p>



<p>“I’m working with Karyn and the art education students to reframe what art education can look like and how art can help us imagine, plan and build an equitable world,” Estrada said. “I hope to show that conversations about how we create an equity centered democracy can start in the art class and be led by artists and art educators.”</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-590x393.jpg" alt="East campus" class="wp-image-94048" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><figcaption>Graduates will have an opportunity to return to campus for a face-to-face graduation ceremony once it is safe to do so.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>More than 5,000 students from the University of Illinois at Chicago who have earned their degrees will have the opportunity to share their hard work with their family and friends through a virtual graduation celebration on May 16.</p>



<p>The celebration is not a replacement for the traditional UIC commencement ceremony, which will be rescheduled once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and health officials have deemed it is safe for public gatherings to resume.</p>



<p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-realizara-celebracion-virtual-de-graduacion">En español</a></p>



<p>The university has teamed up with <a href="http://info.marchingorder.com/">Marching Order</a>, a private company that allows an opportunity for educational institutions to provide a tailored virtual graduation ceremony. At UIC, 14 of the university’s 16 colleges will share information about their graduates onto the Marching Order site through links that will be able to be shared by the graduates themselves. These include the UIC John Marshall Law School as well as the Honors College.</p>



<p>The College of Medicine will have its own virtual celebration on May 8 so that they can begin working in the health field as soon as possible. Students in the Graduate College will participate in their academic college’s online ceremonies.</p>



<p>Of the 5,381 total graduates participating, 3,149 will earn undergraduate degrees while 2,232 will receive graduate/advanced degrees. The largest number of graduates are from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, followed by the College of Engineering and College of Nursing.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of our graduates,” UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis said. “We will confer their degrees in a virtual ceremony so that they can move on with the next phase of their careers. And while we will celebrate virtually this milestone, I view it as a dress rehearsal for the face-to-face celebration that everyone wants to participate in and one that our graduates, their families and their friends deserve. When it is safe to do so, I’m sure that everyone in the class of 2020 will join us for a real celebration on campus.” </p>



<p>Until then, graduates and their families will be able to view congratulatory messages from the chancellor as well as commencement speakers during the May 16 virtual event. The links will go live at 9 a.m. and be viewable afterward. Commencement speakers include: </p>



<ul><li><strong>College of Dentistry</strong>: Dr. Clark Stanford, dean of the College of Dentistry.<br></li><li><strong>Jane Addams College of Social Work</strong>: Paul Makarewicz, MSW ’00, chief mission integration officer for Providence Saint John’s Health Center. He also will be receiving this year’s Jane Addams Pioneer Award.<br></li><li><strong>College of Engineering</strong>: William D. Unger, BA ’71, partner emeritus, Mayfield Fund.<br></li><li><strong>College of Pharmacy</strong>: Rina Shaw, group vice president, specialty and retail pharmacy operations at Walgreens.<br></li><li><strong>College of Business Administration</strong>: Michael Fung, BS’73, chair of the audit committee and member of the board of directors for Franklin Covey, 99 Cents Only Stores and Floor and Décor, and former Walmart executive.<br></li><li><strong>College of Nursing</strong>: Leslie Mancuso, president and chief executive officer of Jhpiego, an international nonprofit health organization affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.<br></li><li><strong>Honors College</strong>: Mary M. Case, university librarian and dean of libraries. </li></ul>



<p>Prior to May 16, graduates will have the opportunity to upload a photo on a slide which will list their names, major and a personal message. The page listing the names of the students and other private information will be available through a link to the graduate, who will be able to share it.</p>



<p>The ceremony with commencement speeches will be open to the public, including the media. </p>
