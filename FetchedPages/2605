				<description><![CDATA[Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty, In the wake of the [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students, Staff, and Faculty,</p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an alarming increase in discriminatory incidents directed at Asians and Asian Americans across this country and across the world. The labeling of COVID-19 as the “Wuhan Virus” and the wide circulation of derogatory social media memes can have harmful consequences for Asians and Asian Americans everywhere and devalue the many contributions they have made to this country for centuries.</p>
<p>So in addition to worrying about the health and well-being of their families and the impact of this pandemic on their work and personal lives, as we all are, members of Asian and Asian American communities, including UIC’s own community, have been experiencing discriminatory acts ranging from name-calling and bullying to physical attacks.</p>
<p>At UIC, we have a long history of working very closely with the many Asian American communities of Chicago and we are very proud to count a large number of Asian and Asian American students and alumni in our ranks. It goes without saying that we denounce these xenophobic practices and rhetoric, which are antithetical to our ethos and culture, and we will not tolerate any form of harassment against Asian and Asian American students, faculty and staff. We recognize that members of our own community may be experiencing such ostracism and violence and that this may be impacting their mental health and well-being. We want you to know that we are here to support you.</p>
<p>Campus units that can provide support include the <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/">Global Asian Studies Program</a>, the <a href="https://aarcc.uic.edu/">Asian American Resource and Cultural Center</a>, the <a href="https://dos.uic.edu/">Office of the Dean of Students</a> and the <a href="https://www.ois.uic.edu/">Office of International Services</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a member of our UIC community who has experienced any form of prejudice, discrimination, or harassment on or off campus and would like to report it, please fill out this <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofIllinoisChicago&amp;layout_id=24">online form</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the history of xenophobia and racism towards Asians and Asian Americans, you can find <a href="https://glas.uic.edu/career-and-resources/teaching-against-racism/">educational resources online</a>.</p>
<p>We are, indeed, all in this together and we ask everyone to take extra care during this time to support each other so that we will emerge from this extraordinary period as an even stronger and more compassionate community.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Amiridis<br />

<p>UI Health Mile Square Health Center — a network of federally qualified health centers, or FQHCs, in Chicago — is now providing COVID-19 testing to community members on the South Side who meet testing criteria at its South Shore clinic, located at 7037 S. Stony Island Ave. </p>



<p>Previously, only established or new Mile Square patients with symptoms were able to get a test. Now, any person in the community who meets testing criteria, such as having symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea, can make an appointment to get tested. Test results will be available in one to two days. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to respond to the needs of the South Shore community and to play an active role in addressing COVID-19 disparities,&#8221; said Dr. Ian Jasenof, chief medical officer of UI Health Mile Square Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mile Square has a long history of bringing health care to communities regardless of individuals&#8217; income, insurance status or ability to pay for care — expanding our COVID-19 testing capacity on Chicago&#8217;s South Side is an extension of our promise to put the health and well-being of all communities at the center of all we do,&#8221; said Henry Taylor, executive director of the UI Health Mile Square network.</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic began testing a limited number of patients today but will test patients by appointment, 10 a.m to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, starting tomorrow. The clinic is prepared to provide up to 30 tests a day. </p>



<p>As part of its expanded testing program, Mile Square has formalized a home monitoring program for individuals who test positive. </p>



<p>&#8220;Follow up and monitoring COVID-19 progression is just
as important as testing,&#8221; Jasenof said. &#8220;We still do not know why some
people with COVID-19 have mild illness while others have severe and
life-threatening illness. This monitoring process was developed to make sure
that if people do become severely ill, they have resources in place to get help
quickly.&#8221; </p>



<p>The South Shore clinic occupies space owned and operated by the Chicago Child Care Society, in Chicago&#8217;s 5th Ward.</p>



<p>“I welcome Mile Square’s capacity to start testing in Shore Shore, which is one of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. While 30 tests per day are a good first start, I hope the staff will have the resources to increase the number of daily tests,” said 5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston. “We know the key to flattening the curve is treatment, testing and tracking.”</p>



<p>Dara Munson, CEO of the Chicago Childcare Society, said, “Chicago Child Care Society has a long-standing commitment to the South Shore neighborhood and is a proud partner with UI Mile Square Health Center.&nbsp;We are saddened but not surprised by the disparities that COVID-19 is illuminating. CCCS is committed to doing our part to serve this and all communities during this pandemic and beyond.”</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic is the third official testing site in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System. The UI Health Mile Square drive-up testing center, located at 1220 S. Wood St., tested its first patient on March 25, and the Pilsen COVID-19 evaluation clinic, located at 1713 S. Ashland Ave., began evaluating and testing patients on March 30. </p>



<p>Combined, these three UI Health testing centers can process around
150 tests each day. </p>



<p>At this time, all testing centers are by appointment only and only for patients who meet testing criteria.</p>



<p>Patients should call 866-600-2273 to speak with a nurse to make an appointment or visit <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-triage">hospital.uillinois.edu</a> for more information. </p>



<p>Mile Square plans to expand its COVID-19 testing program to other locations as well. Next up is its clinic in Cicero, located at 4745–51 W. Cermak Road. Testing at this clinic is expected to start in early May. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a $15.9 million emergency grant program.</p>
<p>The Department of Education has allocated $14.9 million for this grant through the CARES Act. In addition to the Department of Education funding, UIC has transferred $1 million from the Federal Work-Study Program as allowed by the federal government to supplement the emergency grant funding for any student eligible for Title IV Financial Aid funding.</p>
<p><strong>Undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled in the Spring Semester </strong>will be eligible to receive up to $1,000, if you have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Filed a FAFSA and submitted all required documentation to the Office of Student Financial Aid and Scholarships prior to 3/13/2020;</li>

</ol>
<p>The grants may cover expenses such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care.  Because funding is limited, awards will be made on a first-come, first-served basis as follows:</p>
<p>An application is required to receive a grant. <strong>If you are eligible for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, your portal at <a href="https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP">https://my.uic.edu/uPortal/f/welcome/normal/render.uP</a> has been updated with a document for you to complete and upload</strong>. You should have received an email notification informing you that the requirement is posted.<u> Please complete the document immediately as applications will not be accepted after May 8, 2020.</u></p>
<p>If you do not meet the eligibility criteria for the COVID-19 Emergency Grant, you can apply for other Emergency Grant programs available at UIC, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>U and I Cares Emergency Grant through the Dean of Students Office.</li>

<p><em>Please note: UIC John Marshall Law School students may be eligible for the Law School&#8217;s AccessLex-Sponsored and CARES Act Emergency Fund. The Law School received separate funds from the Department of Education and therefore law students are not eligible for UIC COVID-19 Emergency Grant Awards.

				<description><![CDATA[Dear students, faculty and staff, When I began with the [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear students, faculty and staff,</p>
<p>When I began with the first draft of this message, the Earth was a much different place. We had just seen the first effects of the novel coronavirus reach the U.S., and had started preparing to respond. By now, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world. People everywhere are coping with various levels of success and tragedy, and the U.S. has experienced more deaths than any other country. There are not many conditions that can demonstrate so profoundly that we are all connected.</p>
<p>In the midst of these extraordinary circumstances, there have been moments of light. I have watched the videos of people clapping or singing every night from the windows and balconies of Wuhan, Rome, Madrid, New York and here in Chicago, in support of their health care workers, but also in a clear statement that life will go on. In communities across the world, people are coming together for the common good, in ways large and small, but all meaningfully.</p>
<p>We have also seen incredible images documenting how quickly the quality of air and water has improved over much of the world from Punjab to Venice and beyond. This is a stark reminder that our environmental problems can be reversible and our world can be much more beautiful than most of us have experienced in our lifetimes. This could be a great motivation to develop the technological solutions needed in order to achieve the same outcomes, while protecting our financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>Earth Day was created in 1970 from a massive student-led social movement to combat water and air pollution. Today, this movement is more important than ever before, and our Office of Planning, Sustainability and Project Management has continued this year with its strong efforts in support of our desire to become a clean water, carbon neutral and more bio-diverse institution. I urge you to visit the updated <a href="https://sustainability.uic.edu/earthday2020/">Earth Day website</a><u>,</u> which now includes our virtual Earth Day plans. Earth Day is an opportunity to reflect on the complex beauty of our planet and its life-supporting ecosystems, but also to plan and act accordingly, as we continue to do our part to work toward our collective vision of a sustainable and equitable planet.</p>
<p>For now, I urge you to stay well and be safe, while you continue to be informed and active!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael D. Amiridis<br />
Chancellor</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">UIC Faculty and Staff:</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 spreads, we encourage all members of our UIC family to exercise good judgement and social distancing.&nbsp; We continue under the Governor’s Stay-at-Home Executive Order until April 30, 2020. We remind you to stay home if you are ill, and do not come to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;CMS health insurers are&nbsp; covering COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 examinations, including Telehealth visits: <a href="https://www.hr.uillinois.edu/UserFiles/Servers/Server_4208/File/Benefits/CMS%20COVID-19%20health%20plan%20coverage.pdf">https://www.hr.uillinois.edu/UserFiles/Servers/Server_4208/File/Benefits/CMS%20COVID-19%20health%20plan%20coverage.pdf</a></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently revised its list of conditions which put individuals at high-risk for severe illness with COVID-19. They expanded the list of underlying medical conditions and included all people 65 years and older. As such we are revising our recommendations from the March 15<sup>th</sup> Human Resource communication.</p>
<p><strong><u>Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness with COVID-19</u></strong></p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>People 65 years and older</li>
<li>People who live in a nursing home or a long-term care facility</li>
<li>People of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including:
<ul>
<li>People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma</li>
<li>People who have serious heart conditions</li>
<li>People who are immunocompromised
<ul>
<li>Many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>People with severe obesity (body mass index, or BMI, of 40 or higher)</li>
<li>People with diabetes</li>
<li>People with chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis</li>
<li>People with liver disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>For Employees Who Must Work on Campus</u></strong></p>
<p>We continue to encourage supervisors to be flexible and creative in determining ways to meet critical and essential campus work requirements while complying with the Governor’s Stay-at-Home Executive Order.&nbsp; It is particularly important to evaluate and utilize alternative work measures for higher-risk employees as defined above for employees who must remain on site for critical operations. If alternate measures have not already been considered, these employees, effective immediately, should work with their supervisors to make revised work plans and document absences.&nbsp; To the greatest extent possible, higher-risk employees shall be directed to work remotely.&nbsp; Exceptions must be explicitly approved by vice chancellors or deans.</p>
<p>If the employee believes they have a medical condition which qualifies them for a higher risk for severe illness, they must provide medical documentation to that effect to their department/college Human Resources contacts.</p>
<p>Hospital/clinic employees should provide information to Hospital LOA Office (<a href="mailto:uihloa@uic.edu">uihloa@uic.edu</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;Hospital employees should refer to the “COVID-19 BENEFIT TIME GUIDELINES” that were published to the Hospital intranet COVID-19 Resources Tile:&nbsp;<a href="http://intranet.uimcc.uic.edu/COVID-19/Policies%20and%20HR%20Updates/Benefit%20Time%20Guidelines.pdf">http://intranet.uimcc.uic.edu/COVID-19/Policies%20and%20HR%20Updates/Benefit%20Time%20Guidelines.pdf</a></p>
<p>University Health Services will verify the information in consideration of return to work with restriction, accommodation or considered leave.&nbsp; The employee’s supervisor will be notified once verification is complete.</p>
<p>Employees may also be eligible for Emergency Paid Sick Leave and/or Expanded Family and Medical Leave.&nbsp; These two leave types were created effective April 1, 2020 by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA).&nbsp; More information about these leaves can be found at <a href="https://hr.uic.edu/news-stories/families-first-coronavirus-response-act-2/">https://hr.uic.edu/news-stories/families-first-coronavirus-response-act-2/</a></p>
<p>Feel free to direct leave related questions for employees outside of the Hospital and Clinics to UIC Human Resources at uichrleaves@uillinois.edu.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Dear Students, From the beginning of this global health crisis [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content"><p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>From the beginning of this global health crisis we have tried to address the needs of our students as we navigate an unprecedented situation. These are challenging times and we recognize that the disruption to daily routines and university life has impacted each of you significantly.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff have worked diligently to move classes online and minimize the disruption to your education. Students will receive earned credit for completed coursework at the end of this semester. UIC has also purchased and provided laptops and WiFi hotspots to students in need of technology resources to continue their studies remotely. We continue to pay all of our employees, including student employees.&nbsp; The University remains open although most functions have migrated to virtual service delivery, allowing faculty and staff to work from home to comply with Governor Pritzker’s Stay-at-Home order.</p>
<p>We understand that these changes have impacted you financially and many of you have asked about the possibility of UIC providing reimbursement for tuition and student fees. After careful consideration, we will provide an adjustment to your service fee, but we are not able to provide a tuition adjustment, provided that instruction continues and all spring semester courses will be completed. This decision is consistent across the three universities in the University of Illinois System.</p>
<p>In recognition of the suspension of a number of student services due to COVID-19 restrictions and despite the fact that UIC will continue to employ the students that provide the majority of these services, each student will see an adjustment to the amount of the <strong>Service fee</strong> paid as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>All UIC students that paid the full fee amount of $350 (Range I or II) will receive an adjustment and will be credited with $153.</li>
<li>Students that paid the $233 (Range III or IV) fee will receive an adjustment and will be credited with $102.</li>
<li>Any student with a balance owed to the University will have the credit applied to that balance.</li>
<li>Those students who have paid in full will receive a direct deposit transfer to the account on record. If you have not already signed up for direct deposit we encourage you to do so as soon as possible (about 92% of all UI students are enrolled in direct deposit.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, students living in residence halls who chose to move out will receive a prorated refund for their room and meal plan for the remainder of the semester with no financial penalties.</p>
<p>Due to debt service obligations and other fixed costs, fees that support ongoing facility maintenance or finance capital infrastructure costs, cannot be adjusted. This would also apply to any fees for which services continue to be provided, including library and technology access, mental health counseling and advising fees.</p>
<p>Many students have also asked about costs paid for mandatory CTA passes.&nbsp; UIC has already paid the CTA for these passes and as of today, CTA has not responded positively to UIC’s request for a refund. If the situation changes and CTA agrees to a refund, we will immediately pass this back to the students.</p>
<p>We will keep you informed of any additional financial changes, especially in anticipation of the implementation of the federal CARES Act, as soon as new information becomes available.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michael Amiridis<br>
Chancellor</p>
<p>J. Rex Tolliver<br>
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Dear Colleagues, Last week Vice Chancellor Barish and I wrote [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Last week Vice Chancellor Barish and I wrote to inform you that tenure-track faculty at the University of Illinois may apply to add an additional year to their tenure clock. You can view this email <a href="https://provost.uic.edu/news-stories/announcement-about-tenure-track-faculty-probationary-period/">here</a>. We write now to share UIC’s official policy, application procedures, and deadlines.</p>
<p><strong><u>Policy Summary and Application Procedures<br />
</u></strong>Tenure-track faculty, as well as faculty on “Q” probationary appointments, employed during the 2020 Spring semester may apply for a one-year extension of the probationary period under policy #302-1 (this will be known as the COVID-19 Rollback). The criterion for granting the COVID-19 Rollback is that prior to March 1, 2020, the faculty member was making appropriate, demonstrable progress toward attaining indefinite tenure.</p>
<p>Assistant professors who wish to request a tenure rollback or “Q” probationary faculty who wish to request an extension should make the request through the submission of a <a href="https://appserv7.admin.uillinois.edu/FormBuilderSurvey/Survey/uic_faculty_affairs/general/special_agreement_tenure_request/">Special Agreement Regarding Tenure Request</a>. The request should be endorsed by the unit executive officer (department head, chair, director), school director (as applicable), dean, and Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs (as applicable), and submitted for approval by the Provost.</p>
<p><strong><u>Deadlines<br />
</u></strong>COVID-19 requests must be made by the following deadlines to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faculty members currently in the fifth year (T5) of tenure probation or faculty on a “Q” appointment who will be in their final year during academic year 2020-2021 (year of P&amp;T review) MUST complete the request for a COVID-19 rollback by <strong>May 15, 2020</strong>.</li>
<li>Faculty members currently in year one through four (T1 to T4) of tenure probation or “Q” probationary faculty not in the final year of their appointment MUST complete the request for COVID-19 rollback or extension by <strong>December 15, 2020</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please review the complete policy at the following link: <a href="https://uofi.app.box.com/v/tenurerollbackc19">https://uofi.app.box.com/v/tenurerollbackc19</a></p>

				<description><![CDATA[Spring 2020 Graduate Student Grading Policy Dear UIC Graduate Students [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p><strong>Spring 2020 Graduate Student Grading Policy</strong></p>



<p>Dear UIC Graduate Students and Faculty,</p>



<p>Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated effects on UIC graduate students, and with the consent of the UIC Senate Executive Committee and the College Deans, the Office of the Provost is enacting the following modifications to the grading policy for graduate students at UIC for the Spring 2020 Semester:</p>



<p><strong>Grading Modifications for Graduate Students for Spring 2020 </strong></p>



<ul><li>Instructors will report a letter grade for every graduate student in the course as normal.</li><li>Graduate students will receive A and B grades on their transcripts.</li><li>Graduate students will receive Credit (CR) for any C grades.</li><li>Graduate students will receive No Credit (NC) for any D or F grades.</li><li>&nbsp;A grade of CR or NC will not be calculated into the student’s GPA.</li><li>Individual graduate programs will inform graduate students whether they will need to retake courses for which they receive CR or NC in subsequent semesters for a grade.</li><li>Students enrolled in dual degree (Bachelors-Masters) programs who are taking 400-level courses for graduate credit will be subject to these graduate grading modifications for those courses.</li><li> Students enrolled in both IBHE-certified certificates and campus certificates where the Graduate College is the admitting college will be subject to these graduate grading modifications for these courses.  </li></ul>



<p><strong>Incompletes and Academic Probation </strong></p>



<ul><li>Graduate students who received an Incomplete grade for courses taken prior to Spring 2020 will be given an additional semester to fulfill the requirements of their Incomplete grade.</li><li>Graduate students on probation who do not get off probation based on their college requirements in Spring 2020 will have an additional semester to fulfill their probation requirements and will not be penalized for taking courses CR/NC. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Financial Aid Implications </strong></p>



<ul><li>Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) will still be assessed at the end of Spring Semester for all enrolled students.</li><li> CR/NC courses will not count in the student’s cumulative GPA for SAP purpose. <ul><li> Students must still maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA throughout their enrollment. </li></ul></li><li> Courses recorded as NC will count as an attempted/not completed course in a student’s overall completion rate and maximum time frame calculation.   <ul><li> Students must maintain an overall completion rate of 67% to remain financial aid eligible. </li><li> Students must not have&nbsp;attempted more than&nbsp;150% of the required&nbsp;credits of their program&nbsp;to remain financial aid eligible. </li><li> Students failing SAP at the end of Spring semester can still appeal the decision after cancellation occurs.   </li></ul></li></ul>



<p><strong>Academic Deadlines </strong></p>



<ul><li> Registration for Fall 2020 semester opened March 30. </li><li> Course late drop deadline was April 3.</li><li> Registration for Summer Sessions I &amp; II begins on April 15.   </li></ul>



<p><strong>This Policy Applies to Students in all UIC PhD and Masters programs EXCEPT: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Masters of Business Administration (MBA),</li><li>Masters of Engineering (MEng), </li><li>Masters of Public Health (MPH),</li><li>Masters of Jurisprudence (MJ),  </li><li>Masters of Law (LLM),  </li><li>Masters of Social Work (MSW).  </li></ul>



<p><strong>In Addition, the Following Professional Doctoral Programs ARE NOT Covered by this Policy. </strong></p>



<ul><li>College of Applied Health Sciences:<ul><li> Doctor of Occupational Therapy (OTD); </li><li> Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT)   </li></ul></li><li> College of Dentistry: <ul><li> Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) </li></ul></li><li> College of Law:<ul><li>Juris Doctor (JD)   </li></ul></li><li> College of Medicine:  <ul><li> Doctor of Medicine (MD) </li></ul></li><li> College of Nursing:  <ul><li> Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP)  </li></ul></li><li> College of Pharmacy:  <ul><li> Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)  </li></ul></li><li> School of Public Health: <ul><li> Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)   </li></ul></li></ul>

				<description><![CDATA[UIC faculty and staff, As the spread of COVID-19 continues [&#8230;]]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">UIC faculty and staff,</p>
<p>As the spread of COVID-19 continues across the state and nation, we are writing to provide guidance on any necessary steps you should take, as an employee of the university, in the event that you have been exposed to the virus or if you become ill.</p>
<p>Any employee who is experiencing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">life-threatening symptoms</a> should seek the closest care as soon as possible. This may include dialing 911.</p>
<p><strong>For all UIC employees working on site to maintain critical and essential operations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you are experiencing symptoms and need to be tested,</li>
<li>if you may have been exposed to COVID-19, and/or</li>
<li>if you were tested for COVID-19 outside of University Health Services,</li>
</ul>
<p>do not come to work. Isolate at home, contact your supervisor, and call University Health Services at 312-996-7420 and select the COVID-19 option. The call will be directed to a customer service agent who will ask for demographic information (including UIN and supervisor’s email), any potential exposure, and any symptoms you may have. Please have this information available when making the call. The agent will provide you with information on your next steps. This line is available seven days per week, 24 hours a day. Nurse consultation and scheduling will occur Monday through Friday 8 am to 6 pm. Calls outside these times will be returned on the next business day.</p>
<p><strong>For all other UIC employees working remotely: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you are experiencing symptoms and need to be tested,</li>
<li>if you may have been exposed to COVID-19, and/or</li>
<li>if you were tested for COVID-19 outside of University Health Services,</li>
</ul>
<p>do not come to campus. Isolate at home and contact your provider and your supervisor. Contact University Health Services if you test positive, need guidance on work status, or have any questions by completing the online form <a href="https://www.redcap.ihrp.uic.edu/surveys/index.php?s=YMCT94H8AX">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>University Health Services will triage all employee reports, respond to employees, schedule any necessary testing, provide any necessary contact tracing within the University, advise on change of work status, and communicate with employees and supervisors within 24-48 hours. Please note that the University has several testing locations for employees. <strong>These locations are by appointment only</strong>, and are scheduled through this University Health Services process.</p>
<p>In addition to utilizing University Health Services, you also have options to access care through your primary care provider office or medical home. If your medical home is UI Health, you can also contact 866-600-CARE to connect with COVID-19 nurse triage or your primary care clinic.</p>
<p>As a reminder, if you are sick, please stay home. Governor Pritzker has extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30, 2020, and we encourage all members of our UIC family to exercise good judgement and social distancing, which has been deemed as the best way to continue to prevent the transmission of the virus. Employees are encouraged to review the University’s <a href="https://today.uic.edu/coronavirus">website</a> dedicated to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes up-to-date information and resources for our communities.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of one another.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>David C. Marder, MD, MPH<br />
Director, University Health Services</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Because of the unusual circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, the necessity of remote instruction for the last 5 weeks of this semester, special treatment for how student evaluations for the Spring 2020 semester are utilized is in order. Therefore, the following policy will be followed for student evaluations of all faculty, instructors, and lecturers:</p>
<p><strong>POLICY</strong>: Student evaluations of teaching for the Spring 2020 semester may be reviewed only by the faculty member and the faculty member’s department head or chair. The evaluations for any class may be used in the annual merit evaluations and as part of the promotion and tenure review only with the consent of the faculty member.&nbsp; If the faculty member chooses not to permit the use of class evaluations for annual merit review and/or promotion and tenure review, that fact may not be used to make a negative inference or held against the faculty member.</p>
<p>This policy has been approved by the UIC Senate Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Susan Poser<br />
Provost &amp; Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs</p></div>
