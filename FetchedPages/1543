<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-590x393.jpg" alt="silhouettes of people wearing stethoscopes" class="wp-image-17374" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-600x400.jpg 600w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2013/10/NURSING-IMAGE-2-AAN-RELEASE.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></figure></div>



<p>As a show of gratitude and appreciation, the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing and Dean Terri Weaver will celebrate National Nurses Week by providing meals to the nurses at the University of Illinois Hospital, an initiative made possible through a generous gift from&nbsp;husband and wife donors, Frank Naeymi-Rad and Dr. Theresa Kepic, as well as Leap of Faith Technologies Inc. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The donation kickstarts National Nurses Week, May 6-12, and will supply 2,500 healthy, individually wrapped meals to the nurses at the hospital. Meals will be served at breakfast, lunch and dinner to include nurses working in all shifts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Never have nurses deserved our gratitude more than this year,” Weaver said. “They are risking their own health and safety, and that of their families, as they put patient care first during this [COVID-19] health crisis. We deeply appreciate that donors the stature of Frank and Theresa are stepping up to help us thank our nurse colleagues.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Naeymi-Rad is the founder and chairman of Intelligent Medical Objects (IMO®) Inc., and Kepic&nbsp;is a retired obstetrics and gynecology physician who practiced at the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago. In 2019, they acquired Leap of Faith Technologies to support the next generation of innovation in medical informatics. Leap of Faith Technologies is&nbsp;a health informatics company that integrates technology, content and innovative delivery methods to enhance health care&nbsp;experiences, improve patient compliance and health care outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“No words can describe the contribution of our clinical community to our state and country at these challenging times,” Naeymi-Rad said.  “COVID-19 is a wakeup call for humanity and has highlighted the important role our nurses play in our lives. While this pandemic is affecting everyone in the world, it is important that we focus on our community and support our frontline soldiers — our nurses — in this war.” </p>



<p>Nurses are critical to the fight against the coronavirus, serving in every health arena and at every point of care: in emergency rooms, ICUs and recovery wards; from triaging, to testing, to bedside care. Their compassionate care is even more critical now, when hospitals are restricting visitors, and health care providers — particularly nurses — may be the only caregivers that patients see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are learning a lot as our health care delivery teams risk their lives for us, and it is becoming clear how important nursing education and training are in meeting such an unprecedented challenge,” Naeymi-Rad said. “The UIC College of Nursing is a key training asset in our state. Theresa and I are honored to give our support now and into the future, supporting research initiatives with Leap of Faith Technologies Inc.” </p>



<p>“Nurses Week is a time to thank, honor and show our appreciation to our nurses,” said Shelly Major, chief nursing officer for UI Health. “They are working very hard during these uncertain times, and receiving a meal is much appreciated. The thoughtfulness of the college and the donors does not go unrecognized!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nurses working at the University of Illinois Hospital say gifts like this one fortify them to carry on and let them know their work is valued. Clinical assistant professor Julie Schwind is one of the many UIC Nursing faculty, alumni and students who have been working on the frontlines. Because staffing needs have grown, Schwind has been working 12-hour shifts in the neuro stepdown unit. She said nurses are spending more time giving emotional support to patients and speaking to family members on the phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s an amazing spirit among the nurses of UIC,” Schwind said. “There’s so much support for each other going on. I cannot think of a crew of people more deserving of a special thanks. It absolutely is wonderful when you are physically and emotionally&nbsp;tired&nbsp;to&nbsp;not&nbsp;have to think of food; to know someone thought of you. When you spend so much time caring for others, it’s nice to have some of that care being directed back at you.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-590x393.jpg" alt="East campus" class="wp-image-94048" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-590x393.jpg 590w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-387x258.jpg 387w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-768x512.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-1000x667.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-500x333.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110-300x200.jpg 300w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/05/041420_East-Campus-Spring_JC0110.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /><figcaption>Graduates will have an opportunity to return to campus for a face-to-face graduation ceremony once it is safe to do so.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>More than 5,000 students from the University of Illinois at Chicago who have earned their degrees will have the opportunity to share their hard work with their family and friends through a virtual graduation celebration on May 16.</p>



<p>The celebration is not a replacement for the traditional UIC commencement ceremony, which will be rescheduled once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides and health officials have deemed it is safe for public gatherings to resume.</p>



<p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/uic-realizara-celebracion-virtual-de-graduacion">En español</a></p>



<p>The university has teamed up with <a href="http://info.marchingorder.com/">Marching Order</a>, a private company that allows an opportunity for educational institutions to provide a tailored virtual graduation ceremony. At UIC, 14 of the university’s 16 colleges will share information about their graduates onto the Marching Order site through links that will be able to be shared by the graduates themselves. These include the UIC John Marshall Law School as well as the Honors College.</p>



<p>The College of Medicine will have its own virtual celebration on May 8 so that they can begin working in the health field as soon as possible. Students in the Graduate College will participate in their academic college’s online ceremonies.</p>



<p>Of the 5,381 total graduates participating, 3,149 will earn undergraduate degrees while 2,232 will receive graduate/advanced degrees. The largest number of graduates are from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, followed by the College of Engineering and College of Nursing.</p>



<p>“We are very proud of our graduates,” UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis said. “We will confer their degrees in a virtual ceremony so that they can move on with the next phase of their careers. And while we will celebrate virtually this milestone, I view it as a dress rehearsal for the face-to-face celebration that everyone wants to participate in and one that our graduates, their families and their friends deserve. When it is safe to do so, I’m sure that everyone in the class of 2020 will join us for a real celebration on campus.” </p>



<p>Until then, graduates and their families will be able to view congratulatory messages from the chancellor as well as commencement speakers during the May 16 virtual event. The links will go live at 9 a.m. and be viewable afterward. Commencement speakers include: </p>



<ul><li><strong>College of Dentistry</strong>: Dr. Clark Stanford, dean of the College of Dentistry.<br></li><li><strong>Jane Addams College of Social Work</strong>: Paul Makarewicz, MSW ’00, chief mission integration officer for Providence Saint John’s Health Center. He also will be receiving this year’s Jane Addams Pioneer Award.<br></li><li><strong>College of Engineering</strong>: William D. Unger, BA ’71, partner emeritus, Mayfield Fund.<br></li><li><strong>College of Pharmacy</strong>: Rina Shaw, group vice president, specialty and retail pharmacy operations at Walgreens.<br></li><li><strong>College of Business Administration</strong>: Michael Fung, BS’73, chair of the audit committee and member of the board of directors for Franklin Covey, 99 Cents Only Stores and Floor and Décor, and former Walmart executive.<br></li><li><strong>College of Nursing</strong>: Leslie Mancuso, president and chief executive officer of Jhpiego, an international nonprofit health organization affiliated with Johns Hopkins University.<br></li><li><strong>Honors College</strong>: Mary M. Case, university librarian and dean of libraries. </li></ul>



<p>Prior to May 16, graduates will have the opportunity to upload a photo on a slide which will list their names, major and a personal message. The page listing the names of the students and other private information will be available through a link to the graduate, who will be able to share it.</p>



<p>The ceremony with commencement speeches will be open to the public, including the media. </p>

				<description><![CDATA[Health care workers can now participate in HERO research program ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>Health care workers at the University of Illinois
Hospital and Health Sciences System, or UI Health, are now eligible to
participate in a national registry of clinicians working on the frontlines of
the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>



<p>UI Health is part of the University of Illinois at Chicago, which is among the first institutions in the nation to participate in the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes Registry. </p>



<p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://heroesresearch.org/" target="_blank">HERO Registry</a> seeks to engage health care workers, understand their experiences and track their health outcomes related to the pandemic — from COVID-19 infection to stress and burnout. Participant experiences and health outcomes will be tracked via surveys and opportunities, to participate in clinical trials. </p>



<p>As part of the registry, health care workers at UI Health also will have the opportunity to participate in future COVID-19 clinical trials, such as an upcoming study of hydroxychloroquine&#8217;s effectiveness in preventing coronavirus infections in health care workers. This <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/hero-hcq/">study</a>, the first for the HERO Registry, will enroll approximately 15,000 health care workers from participating institutions in the clinical trial to see if hydroxychloroquine performs better than placebo at preventing COVID-19. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="https://today.uic.edu/experts/susan-bleasdale/susan-casey-bleasdale-md-fidsa-facp"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg" alt="Susan Casey Bleasdale, MD, FIDSA, FACP" class="wp-image-92859" width="203" height="305" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6-1000x1500.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Susan-Bleasdale_4x6.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></a><figcaption>Dr. Susan Bleasdale</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>&#8220;This is a great opportunity for our health care workers to share their experiences and the challenges they face as frontline care providers,&#8221; said UIC&#8217;s Dr. Susan Bleasdale, associate professor of clinical medicine at the College of Medicine, medical director of infection prevention at UI Health and principal investigator of the HERO hydroxychloroquine study at UIC. &#8220;We need to study what is happening among health care providers with the same dedication we study what is happening to patients.</p>



<p>&#8220;This information is vital to understanding what
works and what doesn&#8217;t work as we start thinking through the best ways to protect
health care workers, emerge from this crisis and learn from it,&#8221; said
Bleasdale, who is an infectious disease expert. </p>



<p>Bleasdale said that documenting the experiences of health
care providers in real-time during the COVID-19 pandemic can provide invaluable
information to public health departments, hospitals and infectious disease
experts on how to prepare for future outbreaks or a second wave of the COVID-19
pandemic. </p>



<p>The hydroxychloroquine study is expected to begin
enrolling health care workers through the HERO registry on May 4.</p>



<p>The HERO research program leverages <a href="https://pcornet.org/">PCORnet</a>, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, and is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. </p>



<p>More information about the HERO Registry, which is led by Duke University, is available <a href="https://heroesresearch.org/">online</a>. </p>

Pictured are (left to right) Dr. Sodabeh Etminan, Aquila Shelby, Dr. Sai Krishna Kumar, Dr. Christina Wells and Kemeisha Carridice. (Photo: UI Health)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>UI Health Mile Square Health Center — a network of federally qualified health centers, or FQHCs, in Chicago — is now providing COVID-19 testing to community members on the South Side who meet testing criteria at its South Shore clinic, located at 7037 S. Stony Island Ave. </p>



<p>Previously, only established or new Mile Square patients with symptoms were able to get a test. Now, any person in the community who meets testing criteria, such as having symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea, can make an appointment to get tested. Test results will be available in one to two days. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to respond to the needs of the South Shore community and to play an active role in addressing COVID-19 disparities,&#8221; said Dr. Ian Jasenof, chief medical officer of UI Health Mile Square Health Center.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mile Square has a long history of bringing health care to communities regardless of individuals&#8217; income, insurance status or ability to pay for care — expanding our COVID-19 testing capacity on Chicago&#8217;s South Side is an extension of our promise to put the health and well-being of all communities at the center of all we do,&#8221; said Henry Taylor, executive director of the UI Health Mile Square network.</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic began testing a limited number of patients today but will test patients by appointment, 10 a.m to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, starting tomorrow. The clinic is prepared to provide up to 30 tests a day. </p>



<p>As part of its expanded testing program, Mile Square has formalized a home monitoring program for individuals who test positive. </p>



<p>&#8220;Follow up and monitoring COVID-19 progression is just
as important as testing,&#8221; Jasenof said. &#8220;We still do not know why some
people with COVID-19 have mild illness while others have severe and
life-threatening illness. This monitoring process was developed to make sure
that if people do become severely ill, they have resources in place to get help
quickly.&#8221; </p>



<p>The South Shore clinic occupies space owned and operated by the Chicago Child Care Society, in Chicago&#8217;s 5th Ward.</p>



<p>“I welcome Mile Square’s capacity to start testing in Shore Shore, which is one of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. While 30 tests per day are a good first start, I hope the staff will have the resources to increase the number of daily tests,” said 5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston. “We know the key to flattening the curve is treatment, testing and tracking.”</p>



<p>Dara Munson, CEO of the Chicago Child Care Society, said, “Chicago Child Care Society has a long-standing commitment to the South Shore neighborhood and is a proud partner with UI Mile Square Health Center. We are saddened but not surprised by the disparities that COVID-19 is illuminating. CCCS is committed to doing our part to serve this and all communities during this pandemic and beyond.”</p>



<p>The South Shore clinic is the third official testing site in the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System. The UI Health Mile Square drive-up testing center, located at 1220 S. Wood St., tested its first patient on March 25, and the Pilsen COVID-19 evaluation clinic, located at 1713 S. Ashland Ave., began evaluating and testing patients on March 30. </p>



<p>Combined, these three UI Health testing centers can process around
150 tests each day. </p>



<p>At this time, all testing centers are by appointment only and only for patients who meet testing criteria.</p>



<p>Patients should call 866-600-2273 to speak with a nurse to make an appointment or visit <a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/primary-and-specialty-care/infectious-diseases/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and-triage">hospital.uillinois.edu</a> for more information. </p>



<p>Mile Square plans to expand its COVID-19 testing program to other locations as well. Next up is its clinic in Cicero, located at 4745–51 W. Cermak Road. Testing at this clinic is expected to start in early May. </p>

<p>The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration, or NNSA, has awarded $8 million over four years to the University of Illinois at Chicago to lead a multisite, interdisciplinary center focused on research, training and technique development in the study of materials in extreme conditions. </p>



<p>As part of the NNSA&#8217;s Stewardship Science Academic Alliances program, UIC will manage the Chicago/DOE Alliance Center, or CDAC, a Center of Excellence for High Pressure Science and Technology led by Russell Hemley, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Distinguished Chair in the Natural Sciences and professor of physics and chemistry at UIC.</p>



<p>“The center will continue to increase the visibility of NNSA science and UIC’s leading research to the broader U.S. academic community. We are pleased by UIC’s commitment to the center and excited by the proximity of its headquarters to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, with which CDAC partners for research and training, ” said Hemley, who has long been engaged in forefront developments in high-pressure physics, chemistry and materials science.</p>



<p>The center, which had been headquartered in Washington, D.C., since 2003, will continue its coordinated education and outreach program. The program exposes graduate students to extreme conditions science through training at CDAC laboratories and facilitating interactions between NNSA laboratory scientists and academic groups.</p>



<p>CDAC will lead research and training in a broad range of studies of the behavior of materials at various pressures and temperatures, including crystalline solids, fluids and glasses, nanostructured to mesostructured materials, and complex composites.</p>



<p>“This work will expand the boundaries of knowledge in
materials and high pressure science, while also developing the next generation
of scientists to support the stockpile stewardship mission,” said Mark
Anderson, assistant deputy administrator for research, development, test and
evaluation in NNSA’s Office of Defense Programs.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Launched in 2002, the Stewardship Science Academic Alliances program supports areas of fundamental research and development relevant to NNSA’s stockpile stewardship mission and helps recruit the next generation of highly trained scientists and engineers for the Nuclear Security Enterprise.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Additional UIC-affiliated staff involved includes research professors Stephen Gramsch, CDAC deputy director, and Muhtar Ahart, Ravhi Kumar and Zhenxian Liu. External academic partners include researchers from Michigan State University, Northwestern University, University of Buffalo, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Tennessee and University of Utah. </p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2014/02/DG08_01_01_053-387x258.jpg" alt="Bellur S.

<p>University of Illinois at Chicago was selected by the state to produce 160,000 vials of Virus Transport Medium (VTM) — a crucial testing material for COVID-19 — and make them available to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Currently, there is a shortage of VTM throughout the nation as the demand for COVID-19 tests continues to increase. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was contacted by the Governor’s office and asked whether UIC could help out,” said Bellur Prabhakar, UIC professor of microbiology and immunology and senior associate dean for research in the College of Medicine. “Given UIC’s commitment to fighting COVID-19 pandemic and our earlier experience with SARS, it was an easy decision.&#8221; </p>



<p>Prabhakar’s work has been <a href="https://today.uic.edu/inventor-of-the-year-bellur-s-prabhakar">recognized</a> for developing therapeutic <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.706">monoclonal antibodies</a> against SARS and identifying <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/8/4353">antiviral molecules</a> to make SARS vaccines more effective. </p>



<p>UIC started production of the VTM last week.</p>



<p>“Although we have been given 6 to 8 weeks to fill the order, we fully expect to deliver all 160,000 vials to the state well before the end of this month,” Prabhakar said. </p>



<p>Prabhakar and colleagues gathered the four required materials to create the VTM from across the country quickly — in less than three days. Once the VTM is made and sterilized, they also perform quality control to ensure the absence of any microorganisms. </p>



<p>VTM is a critical component for COVID-19 testing. A nasal swab is placed in the VTM to prevent degradation of COVID-19 that may be present in patients’ samples. This gives the state up to a week for shipping and testing.</p>



<p>Also involved in this project are UIC&#8217;s Prabhakaran Kumar and Stefan Green of UIC and volunteers from the UIC Research Resource Center and College of Medicine.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Identifying inhibitors could lead to new medicines to combat the coronavirus]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/SARS-CoV-2.kral_.han_.gif" alt="Computational design of ACE2-based peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2" class="wp-image-93621"/><figcaption> Computational design of ACE2-based peptide inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2.

<p>SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic,
infects cells by using its spike proteins to attach to proteins present on the
surfaces of certain human cells, also known as ACE2 receptors. Upon binding to
ACE2, the virus fuses with the host cell membrane and gains entry via this
attachment.</p>



<p>Finding inhibitors that block key regions of the spike protein and
keep the virus from infecting cells is the focus of many scientists from around
world.</p>



<p>At the University of Illinois at Chicago, researchers recently published a study in the journal <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.0c02857">ACS Nano</a> that details findings from computer simulations seeking to identify these inhibitors, which eventually could assist chemists to develop new medicines to combat the coronavirus.</p>



<p>Using a recently published X-ray crystal structure of the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 when it is bound to ACE2, the researchers
were able to identify 15 amino acids from ACE2 that interact directly with the
viral spike protein.</p>



<p>Yanxiao Han, a UIC Ph.D. student in chemistry and first author on the paper, and Petr Král, UIC professor of chemistry, physics, biopharmaceutical sciences and chemical engineering, used computer modeling to design and assess four peptides that mimic the virus-binding domain of the human protein that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. </p>



<p>Their molecular dynamics simulations revealed a double alpha helix
extracted from ACE2 as a highly stable peptide and potential defender from the
virus, capable of blocking the spike proteins.</p>



<p>“A single alpha helix was not particularly stable,” said Král, senior author of the study. “So, the discovery that a pair of linked self-supporting helices can provide strong and stable binding was very exciting.”</p>



<p>Han and Král hope that simple peptides might do the job of
healing the patients in later stages by slowing down the activity of the virus.
</p>



<p>“Such peptides might have limited secondary impact on the
organisms,” Král said. “These are not vaccines but possible therapeutics for
inhalation.”</p>



<p>The peptides still need to be tested in the lab and in patients, but being able to narrow down drug candidates on the computer could help advance this process, according to the researchers. </p>



<p>Han’s work related to the study is supported through the UIC
Graduate College Dean’s Scholar Fellowship.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The author of 12 plays says of UIC, "Our students inspire me daily"]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/LDiamond-305x406.jpeg" alt="Playwright and professor Lydia Diamond" class="wp-image-93502" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/LDiamond-305x406.jpeg 305w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/LDiamond-194x258.jpeg 194w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/LDiamond.jpeg 481w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /><figcaption>Lydia Diamond, playwright and UIC clinical associate professor of theatre.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago&#8217;s Lydia Diamond grew up moving frequently as her single mother’s musical and academic teaching career took her from one university to another. During this time, her mother also earned advanced degrees and taught future artists.</p>



<p>Diamond came from a family of musicians and educators, so she had been required to take violin lessons from the time she was 6. In high school, she managed to convince her mother to let her put down the violin in favor of letting the theatre be her mode of artistic expression.</p>



<p>After earning an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and spending a decade performing professionally, she realized that her true calling was as a playwright.</p>



<p>Diamond, UIC clinical associate professor of theatre in the School of Theatre and Music within the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, was recently named the recipient of the 2020 Horton Foote Playwriting Award. The award comes with a $25,000 prize that will be awarded in July. She has nine published plays including her latest work, &#8220;Toni Stone,&#8221; which was critically acclaimed, and named Critic’s Pick by the New York Times.  In addition to &#8220;Toni Stone,&#8221; her plays include &#8220;Smart People,&#8221; &#8220;Stick Fly,&#8221; &#8220;Harriet Jacobs,&#8221; &#8220;Voyeurs de Venus,&#8221; &#8220;The Gift Horse,&#8221; &#8220;The Inside,&#8221; and her adaptation of Toni Morrison’s novel, &#8220;The Bluest Eye.&#8221; She also has written for television.</p>



<p>She recently spoke about her life and career and how UIC helps inform her writing.</p>



<h2><strong>Tell us how you feel about winning the Horton Foote award?</strong></h2>



<p>It’s so exciting, I don’t win a lot of awards so when I saw, “Congratulations” on the subject line of an email I thought, &#8220;Oh right, it’ll be something like, &#8216;Congratulations you have won an opportunity to buy a book,&#8217; or some such.&nbsp;Then I opened it and it was real… and I kept reading, the news got better and better. I was teaching a class in about five minutes, and so after my mom and my boyfriend, the first people who knew were my UIC students. I lived in Texas when I was in high school, so I have an affection for Horton Foote in general and am a great admirer of his work. To receive an award in his name is a great honor.</p>



<h2><strong>How did you get into playwriting and how many plays have you written?</strong></h2>



<p>I’ve written about 12 plays, nine of them have been published and are produced regularly. I started playwriting in college. I went to Northwestern and was one of only two theatre majors of color at the time. There just weren’t many roles available to me, so I started writing my own material, writing one-woman shows and plays. At that time in Chicago (I think it’s not so different now), you could find a space in which to produce a show, call yourself a theatre company, send out a press release, and reviewers would actually come and review the work.&nbsp; I worked in this place, Café Voltaire, where I was a cook, a waitress, a hostess and the manager of this little theater space in the basement.&nbsp; That’s where I produced my first shows. Ironically that’s where, over two decades ago, I first met Yasen Peyankov, head of UIC’s Theater Department. He was directing a production of &#8220;Macbeth&#8221; there. </p>

<h2><strong>What are the themes that you go back to and why? </strong></h2>



<p>Most of my work deals with themes of class, race and gender. I think it’s because I have always written about the things that are hard for us to talk about; things that confound and/or disgust or continue to shock me. I’m an African American woman, and I move through a world that has a relationship with African American people that is deeply problematic. I’m always amazed at how hard it is for all of us — people of all races — to talk about these things. I work out my questions and I work out trying to figure it out in my plays. It doesn’t mean that I’m writing political plays that are didactic and only about that. I’m writing plays that are about families and I’m writing plays about interesting historical figures and I’m writing plays about contemporary people of various ethnicities, sexual orientations, and classes. People who look like the folks I interact with daily. If you are a person of color, this is the world you are navigating. So, those themes are always going to come up in my work.&nbsp; </p>



<h2><strong>Which is the latest play that is being produced and how does it fit into your overall anthology?</strong></h2>



<p>It is &#8220;Toni Stone.&#8221; It took four years to write and is the true story about the first woman of any race to play in a professional baseball game when she played with the Indianapolis Clowns of the professional Negro Leagues. It started at the Roundabout Theater in New York. The American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco just put up its second production, also directed by Pam MacKinnon. Sadly, because of COVID-19, it closed the day after its opening.&nbsp;What’s great is that they’ve taped it and are making tickets for patrons to purchase and view online. It’s slated to be done at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., if we’re back to business as usual by July. I’ve just heard that there are about 10 productions of it around the country for the following season. </p>



<h2><strong>The New York production of &#8216;Toni Stone&#8217; garnered very good reviews. How does that make you feel?</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout my career, my New York reviews were often not as flattering as the ones from other cities around the country. This is my first experience with critical raves in New York. It’s so very exciting, but I was also astounded and concerned because I didn’t realize how much of an impact it would have on the success of the play in every way. The industry needs to look at the ecology of the American theatre, which puts so much emphasis on the opinions of one or two reviewers in New York, to be the arbiters of what happens to the future of that play.&nbsp;They have the power to affect the number of future productions that a play might have, and its financial viability in general.&nbsp;So, yes, it felt wonderful to get raves across the board, AND, yes, it is all very arbitrary and a bit like winning the lottery when it happens.</p>

<h2><strong>Since you were a theater major as an undergrad, are you still an actor?</strong></h2>



<p>Good God no! No, no, no. I’m not. It just took me a long time to realize that. I majored in acting and you spend a lot of time convincing your family that you’ll be OK. I learned now, as I’ve gotten older, I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and my brain doesn’t want to hold on to lines. I seriously struggled my whole acting career to just learn my lines, which means I never really got to act because I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the character; so much of my attention went to trying to remember my lines. Though I was working steadily, I was miserable and expecting to be fired. It was awful. My then-husband was like, “It doesn’t seem like you like acting.” And I thought, ‘Oh, wow, that’s true. I don’t have to do this.’ By that time, my playwriting career had taken off. It was just a matter of saying to myself and then to people, ‘I’m a playwright.’ As opposed to saying, ‘I’m an actor, and I write plays.’ It was very liberating.</p>



<h2><strong>What do you teach at UIC and what words of advice can you give students about writing for theater? </strong></h2>



<p>I teach Playwriting, Script Analysis, a class called Contemporary Performance Techniques, in which people create their own work and we put on a show at the end of the semester. I tell my students to just write. Write as much as they can, all the time without judging themselves and their writing. I think it’s important that you don’t turn to other people for affirmation about what you do and how you do it (another issue I have with the reality of reviews).&nbsp;You write because you have stories to tell that are interesting but we have a tendency to think, ‘I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show at the Goodman Theatre, or I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show on Broadway.’ It took me 22 years of a successful playwriting career before I had a show on Broadway. If you think you’re writing so you can have certain kinds of accolades, you’ll lose your mind. There are too few opportunities and too many people who are good artists, for us to let the opinions of others dictate our artistic viability. Sure, you send a play out to theatres in hopes that it will be produced one day, but in the meantime, you must make a way for yourself. You write the play, then you find a church, or the basement of a vegetarian restaurant, or the back of a bar, recruit some of your friends, invite people to see it, and that’s being successful in the theater. </p>



<h2><strong>How has UIC helped you achieve your goals and your dreams?</strong></h2>



<p>Our students inspire me daily.&nbsp;I love them! They have incredible work ethics and a great deal of talent. Refreshingly, our students are lacking in something that I have seen at universities that cater to more economically privileged students.&nbsp;Our students tend not to indulge in ‘Am I talented enough?’ neurosis. They’re like, ‘I’m here to learn, and I’m working very hard to be here. Teach me.’ The prevailing attitude is: ‘Let’s go, let’s do this,’ and that is inspiring to me.&nbsp;Also, UIC is the first place I’ve ever worked where the students are wonderfully diverse, especially racially. I think that’s such a gift to the students and bodes well for our institution. They will leave UIC with a certain cultural fluency, a privilege that a lot of people just don’t have. </p>

<p>University of Illinois at Chicago researchers report that in depressed individuals there are increased amounts of an unmodified structural protein, called tubulin, in lipid rafts — fatty sections of a cell membrane — compared with non-depressed individuals.</p>



<p>Their findings are <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2020/04/11/JNEUROSCI.3033-19.2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">published</a> in the Journal of Neuroscience. </p>



<p>Tubulin is part of a protein complex that provides structure to cells. This complex also is involved in binding a specific protein called Gs alpha, or Gsa, which is a signaling molecule that conveys the action of neurotransmitters like serotonin. </p>



<p>Previous work established that high levels of Gsa were in the lipid rafts of depressed individuals and that Gsa lost effectiveness when in those lipid rafts. Gsa moved out of the lipid rafts after treatment with antidepressants or after using a drug inhibitor for histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC-6) — an enzyme that removes modifications from tubulin — suggesting a role of tubulin in depression as well. </p>



<p>Mark Rasenick, UIC professor of physiology and psychiatry at
the College of Medicine, and colleagues analyzed post-mortem brain tissue from
individuals with and without a diagnosis of depression to determine the
location and degree of modified tubulin. A subgroup for depression also
included individuals who died by suicide. </p>



<p>“While some studies suggest that there are differences between depressed individuals who died by suicide and those that did not, we observed a profound decrease in the extent of acetylated tubulin in lipid raft membranes from brains of all depressed subjects,” said Rasenick, who is also a research career scientist at the Jesse Brown Veteran Affairs Medical Center. </p>



<p>In all groups, there were no significant changes in the amounts of modified alpha tubulin, HDAC-6, or alpha tubulin acetyltransferase 1 — a protein that adds modifications to tubulin. However, there was less modified tubulin found in the lipid rafts of both depression groups versus the non-depressed group. According to Rasenick, the data suggest that diminished tubulin acetylation may be essential in harnessing Gsa to lipid rafts during depression. Antidepressants reverse this process and allow fuller function of Gsa and the neurotransmitters that activate it.</p>



<p>PAX Neuroscience Inc., a company created by Rasenick, researches
how Gsa localization
could be a diagnostic <a href="https://today.uic.edu/innovator-of-the-year-develops-blood-test-for-clinical-depression">biomarker</a>
in blood cells to identify individuals with depression. Now the company will explore
tubulin-related depression therapeutics and diagnostics. This may add new
approaches to therapy and create diagnostic platforms to determine, in just a
few days, whether an antidepressant is working.</p>



<p>“This work is important because half of the people who appear to be suffering from depression don’t seek treatment,” Rasenick said. “This is likely due to the social stigma surrounding people with psychiatric problems. But having an identified biological basis for depression could help people to realize that depression is not &#8216;their failure&#8217; and allow them to treat it like any other illness.”</p>

UIC photo. </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Special Collections and University Archives is launching a project to collect stories, photos, artwork and other current materials from the university community to document how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting life at UIC.</p>



<p>The effort, dubbed Six Feet Apart: Stories from UIC during COVID-19, is a way to document history in the making as the world, the nation, municipalities and college institutions, including UIC, attempt to cope with this pandemic. As with past pandemics, the records created by these entities will be studied in the future.</p>



<p>The University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, the UIC Humanities in Medicine (HuMed) student group and the UIC College of Medicine are leading the effort to collect documentation that could aid future historians. </p>



<p>This is important as journalists, bloggers and scholars have relied on historical documentation from the 1918 flu epidemic to garner lessons that help us in the present, said Megan Keller Young, special collections librarian.  </p>



<p>“This project is a way to capture personal reflections, which are all too often missing from the historical record,” said Keller Young. “This is a historical event all of us are going through together, but no one in quite the same way. All of these experiences should be documented for future researchers.” </p>



<p>The organizers are asking current UIC students, faculty and staff to share their stories and experiences of how their lives have been impacted by COVID-19. The submissions will be preserved in the University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, where they will be publicly available to students, researchers and other visitors to the library. Submissions can be written accounts, videos, photos and more. Selected materials eventually will be included in a digital exhibit chronicling the current pandemic.</p>



<p>It’s important to document how quickly and dramatically everything has changed in a “blink of the eye,” said UIC medical student Chioma Ndukwe, one of the leaders of the History/Ethics subcommittee for HuMed. She said the humanities have always served to document the “how and why” of history.</p>



<p>“Everyone has been working hard during this crisis — health care workers, IT techs, professors, students, maintenance workers and many more,” Ndukwe said. “I wanted those efforts to be documented; that way people years or even decades in the future can look back and learn from and about our experiences today.”</p>



<p>UIC students, staff, and faculty are being asked to provide details on their day-to-day lives such as how they are coping with the transition to online learning, how graduating students are impacted by the pandemic in their final year, how their future employment prospects are also affected and the challenges of working from home. The project organizers especially hope to collect the experiences of those working in the University of Illinois Hospital &amp; Health Sciences System.</p>



<p>To submit their stories and experiences, UIC students, staff and faculty should use the submission form where they may contribute as much detail about themselves as they wish. Though they must provide an email address in case they need to be contacted by library staff, submissions can be anonymized when added to the collection.</p>

<p>University of Illinois at Chicago senior Anis Barmada is one of 49 international students to win the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship for graduate studies at&nbsp;the University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>Barmada, a UIC Honors College member majoring in biological sciences and chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, was selected in the highly competitive selection process, which emphasizes outstanding academic achievement and social leadership. The newly elected international cohort joins more than two dozen scholars from the U.S., who were announced in February, to complete the Gates Cambridge class of 2020.</p>



<p>The
prestigious scholarship, which aims to build a global network of future leaders
committed to improving the lives of others, is funded by the Gates Cambridge
Trust established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>



<p>Barmada, who grew up in Damascus,
Syria, and immigrated to the U.S. in 2015, will
pursue a master’s degree in genomic medicine in the department of
medical genetics in the School of Clinical Medicine at Cambridge.</p>



<p>“I hope to visualize the molecular, analytical, statistical, social and clinical challenges facing the use of omics-based personalized medicine across everyday clinics,” he said. “Professionally, I intend to pursue an MD/Ph.D. advancing biochemical and computational technologies to address currently incurable diseases and contributing to the crafting of a new era of health care without disparities.&#8221;</p>



<p>Barmada, who
is minoring in mathematics, is part of the President’s Award Program STEM
Initiative at UIC, which is a selective peer and faculty network for students
in STEM disciplines to do research, develop professional connections and
prepare for graduate education.</p>



<p>Since his first year at UIC, he
has conducted research on diabetic eye disease in the laboratory of Scott
Shippy, UIC associate professor of chemistry and bioengineering, while also
volunteering at an ophthalmology clinic that serves patients of the same
life-changing, blindness-causing disease conditions.</p>



<p>“Through
these experiences, I found an articulation of my interests in patient-driven
research that considers both the biochemical and socioeconomic lenses,” he
said. </p>



<p>Shippy considers Barmada “nothing short of remarkable” and, as an example, noted his key role in the lab’s project to collect tears from mice to look for markers of disease that resulted in two first-author publications from the young researcher. </p>



<p>“He has grown tremendously from those first days learning the basic lab techniques to the present day with a research-oriented opinion article under review in an ophthalmology journal,” Shippy said. “With his intellect and astounding work ethic, I predict he will have a large impact on the future of health care as a scientist-physician.”</p>



<p>The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is the latest honor for Barmada, who earned a prestigious Goldwater scholarship in 2019 and was among the U.S. finalists for a 2020 Rhodes Scholarship.</p>



<p>He is the recipient of several scholarships and awards, in addition to research support via Honors College research grants, the Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative and the chemistry department’s Herbert E. Paaren Summer Research Stipend.</p>



<p>Barmada, a resident of Mount Prospect and 2016 graduate of Wheeling High School, is the fifth UIC student to win a Gates Cambridge Scholarship since the program was established through a $210 million donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000.</p>



<p>UIC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://oef.uic.edu/">Office of External Fellowships</a>&nbsp;provides advising and assistance
to current undergraduate and professional school students in finding and
applying for a range of nationally and internationally competitive fellowships,
scholarships and grants.</p>
