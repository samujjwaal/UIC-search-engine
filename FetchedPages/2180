        <h3>New Undergraduate</h3>
        <p>New undergraduate students will register for the fall and spring semesters as part of the New Student Orientation Program, which is conducted during the summer months. New undergraduate students will receive information in the mail telling them how to reserve places in summer orientation sessions.</p>

        <h3>New Graduate</h3>
        <p>If you are a new, degree seeking graduate student, you will receive advising information from your department.</p>

        <h3>Continuing Students</h3>
        <p>All eligible continuing students will be able to view their time ticket (appointment to register) on the web in mid March for registration for summer and fall courses. Time tickets are available on the web in mid October for registration for spring courses. Students in certain Health Sciences professional colleges may receive other registration information from their colleges.</p>

        <h3>Visiting/Summer Session Students</h3>
        <p>If you are NOT a UIC student but you are an undergraduate at another college or university and are interested in taking courses at UIC in the summer, you will need to complete a Summer Session Only Application. You can apply directly online on the Summer Session web site at <a href="http://summer.uic.edu">summer.uic.edu</a>. Additional application information is also available through the Summer Session Office - (312) 996-9099<!-- or (800) 625-2013-->. Once admitted, you can register online through the <a href="https://my.uic.edu" title="UIC Student Portal">XE Registration system (available via my.UIC.edu)</a>. You do this during the Open Registration Period, which begins late April.<!-- Note: For students who choose not to, or are unable to, provide a social security number (SSN), a 9 digit Temporary Control Number (TCN) will be assigned and noted in your letter of admission. This number should be used in place of the SSN for student account setup purposes.--></p>

        <h2 class="orangeFont">Class Standing</h2>
        <p>The University requires a student to earn at least 120 semester hours of acceptable credit in order to receive a baccalaureate degree. The exact required number of hours varies according to college, school, and curriculum. Student academic classification is determined as follows:</p>
        <h3>Class Semester Hours</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Freshmen 0 through 29</li>
            <li>Sophomores 30 through 59</li>

        <h3>Courses:</h3>
        <p><strong>From 001-099:</strong> Courses contribute toward the calculation of tuition, full- or part-time enrollment status, and financial aid eligibility. Grades for these courses are not calculated in the grade point average, nor do these courses carry credit towards graduation.</p>

        <p><strong>From 100-199:</strong> Open to all undergraduates, particularly first year students.</p>
        <p><strong>From 200-299:</strong> Intended for sophomores, juniors and seniors who have completed 100-level prerequisites.</p>
        <p><strong>From 300-399:</strong> Intended for juniors and seniors, and sophomores who have completed 200-level prerequisites.</p>

        <h2 class="orangeFont">Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Prerequisites, if any, are included in the course description. Students are responsible for completing all prerequisites prior to enrolling in a course. For some courses, the student registration system will prevent students from registering if prerequisites have not been completed. Regardless of whether or not the registration system prevents a student from enrolling in a course, the University will not be responsible for a student's failure to adhere to those prerequisites.</p>

        <h2 class="orangeFont">Late Registration - Drop/Add Period</h2>
        <p>All students unable to enroll during advance registration must register during the Late Registration and Drop/Add period which extends until the second Friday of fall, spring or summer full term; the first Wednesday of Summer Session 1; the first Friday of Summer Session 2, and the first Friday of Parts of Term A and B.</p>
        <h3>Late Registration after Online Drop/Add Period</h3>
        <p>Students who are unable to register for classes by the conclusion of the online add/drop period may contact their college to find out the late registration petition process.   If late registration is approved a  $50.00 late fee will be assessed.</p>
        <h3>Adding Classes after First Week</h3>
        <p>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences  (LAS) restricts entry into classes after the first week of the fall and spring term, regardless of whether the class is still available. Students are advised to check with the course instructor teaching the class before enrolling. In addition, all pre-requisite requirements for course registration must be met by enrolling students.<br>
            <br>
            <a name="eligibility"></a></p>
        <h2 class="orangeFont">Eligibility to Register</h2>
        <p>Currently enrolled continuing students are eligible to register during advance registration. Information about registration will be sent in an email notification to students. Students who are continuing but not currently enrolled are eligible to register beginning with the Open Registration period. Readmitted students will receive registration information along with their notices of readmission.</p>
        <p><strong>You are NOT ELIGIBLE to register if you:</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Have lost continuing status (i.e., have not attended for two or more semesters in succession, excluding summer session or approved leave of absence).</li>
            <li>Missed the term of admittance.</li>
            <li>Were dropped by your college or the University for poor scholarship or disciplinary reasons. </li>
            <li>Have a financial indebtedness to the University. </li>
            <li>Failed to satisfy the requirements of the Illinois Proof of Immunity Law. </li>
            <li>Have any other academic or administrative hold that precludes registration. </li>

            <a name="holds"></a></p>
        <h2 class="orangeFont">Holds</h2>
        <p>If you have a hold on your records, you may not register or, in many cases, obtain transcripts until that hold is cleared with the office imposing the hold. A hold may be imposed for financial indebtedness to the University (i.e., unpaid tuition and fees, unpaid library fines), reasons pertaining to unmet financial aid obligations, academic or disciplinary reasons, or an incomplete Medical Immunization Record. If you have not cleared your holds before the start of Advance Registration, your registration will not be accepted until the hold is cleared!</p>
        <h3>Advising Hold</h3>
        <p>An advising hold may be placed on your record if you are in a college that requires advising prior to registration. You must complete an advising session before your college will clear you to enroll.</p>
        <h3>Pending Graduation Registration Hold</h3>
        <p>Undergraduates who have submitted an Intent to Graduate will have a Pending Graduation Registration Hold placed to prevent registration for future terms.  This hold can be lifted by a college advisor.  College policies vary in regard to allowing students to register beyond the initial bachelor&rsquo;s degree.  Contact with an advisor is needed when an undergraduate degree is to be earned and registration is sought for future terms.  Please note that students enrolled in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences may only have their hold lifted if they cancel their intent to graduate.</p>
        <h3>Financial Hold</h3>
        <p>You cannot register if you are indebted to the University. You may verify your account balance by going to <a href="https://my.uic.edu" title="UIC Student Portal">my.UIC.edu</a> and clicking on the Finances tab.</p>
        <p>You may clear a financial hold by paying your past due balance. Please visit <a href="https://paymybill.uillinois.edu/MakingPayments" title="University of Illinois USFCO - How to Make Payments">https://paymybill.uillinois.edu/MakingPayments</a> for detailed information on making payments to the University.</p>

        <h3>Immunization Hold</h3>
        <p>The Illinois Department of Public Health requires that all students born on or after January 1, 1957, entering a post secondary institution, and living in on-campus housing, are required to present documented proof of immunity against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, and diphtheria as a prerequisite to registration. Students in the health professions colleges are also required to provide proof of immunity against polio and tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>An immunization hold will be placed on your record if you are not properly immunized and have not submitted a written statement of medical, philosophical, or religious exemption. A religious exemption need not be based on the tenets of an established religion.  You will not be permitted to register until you have cleared the medical immunization hold. To clear the hold, you must submit a comprehensive immunization record, certified by a health care provider, to the Office of Medical Immunization Records prior to your appointed registration day.</p>
        <p>Students registering only for on-campus courses (including any prior terms) or for more than five credit hours (including any prior terms) are required to comply with immunization requirements. Prior to registering for on-campus courses or for more than five credit hours, students must submit proof of immunity or secure an approved medical or religious exemption.</p>

        <h3>Intent of the Program</h3>
        <p>The intent of the Intercampus Registration Program is to allow students at one campus of the University the opportunity to take advantage of experiences unique to another campus of the University without having to transfer. It is not designed to replace concurrent enrollment or transfer. The program also provides for summer enrollment at another University campus. </p>
        <h3>How the program works </h3>
        <p>If a student is interested in participating in the program the student should: </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
