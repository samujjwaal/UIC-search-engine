          <div class="testimonial__quote"><p>After receiving her baccalaureate in Computer Engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering, Dana joined Johnson Controls as a Technology Development Engineer. Working with building controls she was becoming more involved with HVAC. In meetings with clients Dana realized there was a blending of controls and energy; she began to realize that her Facility Management clients were being assigned business goals around saving energy and Energy Managers were becoming more involved in the HVAC/controls decision-making process. She perceived a need to learn more about energy engineering if she were to stay current in her career. On the advice of a mentor working in energy she decided to earn her Master’s degree and enrolled in the Master of Energy Engineering program.</p>
<p>It was a long commute from Milwaukee to UIC, but her Master of Energy Engineering degree has helped Dana advance her career. When asked what advice she would give future Energy Engineers, Dana said, “Think outside the box. Be creative in how you find savings in your facilities.”</p>
<p>Sounds like excellent advice. In addition to engineering, Dana also has a passion for entrepreneurship and early-stage investing. One of her industries of focus is of course…Energy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon graduating with a Master of Energy Engineering degree, Farhan went to work for RTM Engineering Consultants where he is a Project Engineer.  In his job, Farhan is responsible for designing mechanical, plumbing and fire protection systems for variety of building types.

          <div class="testimonial__quote"><p>Meet Ryan Ollie. In just six years he has grown from mechanical engineer at a MEP consulting firm to energy engineer at DNV GL to his current position as Manager of Energy Solutions at Advocate Health Care!</p>
<p>Ryan received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan. While working as an energy engineer at DNV GL, a co-worker and MEE alumni introduced him to the MEE program. Ryan did his research and saw how applicable the program was to his job. He was very interested in building upon his knowledge of HVAC systems and learning more about the energy industry as a whole. Ryan enrolled in the program and was soon promoted to a manager position.</p>
<p>Today, Ryan enjoys his role as the Manager of Energy Solutions for Advocate Health Care. This is a relatively new role for the organization and it keeps Ryan busy traveling between multiple campuses developing energy efficiency projects and implementing unique strategies to maximize energy savings. Ultimately, he is responsible for achieving a very significant energy reduction goal for his organization, by 2020. Ryan is confident that they will achieve their goal, but since Healthcare is the second most regulated industry in the country, he has his work cut out for him!</p>

<p>First was the ASHRAE scholarship which is awarded to exceptional students with excellent academic merit who are interested in a career in the field of heating, ventilation and air conditioning engineering. Panos then won the IBPSA scholarship which sent him to the recent Energy Modeling conference in Atlanta. To complete this impressive year Panos was the recipient of the Consular Corps Scholarship. This prestigious award is given to an international student with a minimum 3.5 GPA.</p>
<p>Panos definitely knows the value of education. He earned his BS in Civil Engineering at the TEI of Athens, Greece and his interest in buildings brought him to Chicago where he received a BS in Architectural Engineering from Illinois Institute of Technology. He knew he wanted his MS degree, but one with a continued emphasis on Building Science. That led him to the Master of Energy Engineering program at University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<p>What’s next for this award-winning student? Panos definitely wants to add PE to his credentials and then, maybe an MBA! With his track record anything is possible.</p>
<p>Congratulations Panos!</p>

<p>After considering a MBA Ben discovered the Master of Energy Engineering (MEE) program at UIC &#8211; a program he considered ahead of other energy engineering programs. Ben stated that having a MEE degree was important to becoming a PMF. When he was being vetted he had to be very specific about what he wanted to do with his career and his background with the MEE gave him an edge. He believes the MEE program was a launch pad for getting to work on important energy issues. The real world experience of the MEE faculty was invaluable and added another dimension to the courses. In addition to his work in the MEE program, Ben was a participant in the Summer Institute on Sustainability – another unique UIC experience.</p>

          <div class="testimonial__quote"><p>Wildivina’s first experience with energy auditing was as an undergrad working at the University of Florida’s Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) where she led a team of 8 students through various manufacturing site energy surveys. Upon graduating from undergrad, Wildivina interned in Washington D.C. performing commercial site energy audits. This summer internship, and her previous work at the IAC, further convinced her that she wanted to pursue a career in the energy industry and the Master of Energy Engineering program was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Wildivina can tell you that networking pays off. While attending an industry conference prior to starting the MEE program, she introduced herself to a recruiter for future reference. After starting the program Wildivina realized she had the time to both pursue her career and work on her degree. She contacted the recruiter who then introduced her to Siemens where she is still employed.</p>
<p>Did working on her Master of Energy Engineering degree help her land the job? Wildivina thinks it did. Siemens had employed other MEE students and knew that the real world experience gained in the program allows the employee to become effective on the job very quickly and eliminate the need for lengthy training.</p>
<p>When asked if she had any advice for women thinking of working in the Energy Engineering field, Wildivina had two suggestions: Improve your communication skills; effective communication is critical to the job. Secondly, don’t be afraid to be the only woman!</p>

After receiving his undergraduate degree in Engineering Maher began working in a sustainable buildings design firm located in Jordan. He knew he wanted to specialize in this field and further his education in energy engineering. Why UIC? Not only was the Master of Energy Engineering program exactly what he was looking for, but a recommendation from a colleague who had received her Masters of Architecture at UIC finalized the decision.</p>
<p>Maher has been in his new job with Baumann Consulting as an Energy Engineer since he graduated from UIC. He credits the MEE Energy Auditing and HVAC courses in particular for preparing him for the real world. Moreover, it was the sustainable and renewable energy course project that motivated him with an idea that was registered as a US provisional patent. He has filed his idea with the US Patent Office, set up a prototype and will begin testing and evaluating the innovation soon.This idea was selected to be one of the GIST Tech-I 2014 semi-finals which is a global innovation competition organized by the US Department of State and American Association for Advanced Science.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Maher!</p>

I found the Masters of Energy Engineering (MEE) program and liked that I could work while I took classes. I started the MEE program the same time I started a new job at The Shaw Group. I believe my enrollment in the MEE program was definitely a factor in getting the job. Shaw was very interested in the program and currently has one employee enrolled with another one starting class soon.</em></p>
<p><em>I thought it was convenient taking classes and working. Interestingly, everything I was learning in class mirrored what I was doing at work.”<br />

The name Master of Energy Engineering accurately defines the program – it is more technical, more focused and creates more job opportunities. My job is quite challenging and having a MEE degree has helped me to think more practically than theoretically.&#8221;<br />
