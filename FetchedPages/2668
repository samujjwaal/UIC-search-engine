<p> 
Whenever we want to buy a product or use a service, we often have some 
questions about the product or service. If these questions can be answered 
immediately, it will help us make the purchase decision enormously. Thus, 
question-answering plays an important role in e-commerce. This work 
explores the potential of turning customer reviews into a large
source of knowledge that can be used to answer user questions. 
We call this problem <i>Review Reading Comprehension</i> (RRC). 

<p> 
Given the ever-changing environment of products and services, it is very 
hard, if not impossible, to pre-compile an up-to-date and reliable knowledge 
base to cover a wide assortment of questions that customers may ask, such 
as in factoid based KB-QA. As a compromise, many online businesses leverage 
community question-answering (CQA) to crowdsource answers from existing 
customers. However, the problem with this approach is that many questions 
are not answered, and if they are answered, the answers are delayed, which
is not suitable for interactive QA. In this work, we explore the potential 
of using product reviews as a large source of user experiences that can 
be exploited to obtain answers to user questions
