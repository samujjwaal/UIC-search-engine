[5/03/2016] Please join me in welcoming the newest member of our group, Michela Sainato. Michela officially started as a postdoctoral scholar with our group as of yesterday. We are all very excited to have Michela join us. She will continue Tanim's work on developing highly sensitive and selective carbon nanotube sensors. She joins us after successfully completing a PhD from University of Pisa in Italy and a postdoctoral scholar at the molecular foundry at LBNL. Welcome to UIC Michela ! <br><br>

[3/14/2016] Lets all congratulate Tanim passing his PhD. thesis defense with flying colors earlier today. His PhD thesis, titled "Multi Walled Carbon Nanotube Based Chemoresistive Methane Sensors," makes substantial scientific contributions in the area of low-cost/low-power gas sensors, and sets up research in our group for years to come. Tanims committee members are: Prof. Igor Paprotny (advisor and chair), Dr. Ralu Divan, Dr. Lara Gundel, Dr. Paul Solomon, Prof. Alan Feinerman, Prof. Michael Stroscio. <br><br>

[3/3/2016] Please join me in congratulating Dorsa, Ameen, Ratul, Omid, Andrew, and Troy, as well as many co-authors for having a <b>whooping three papers</b> accepted in the Hilton Head Workshop 2016: A Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Workshop. This highly competitive single-track conference highlights the best in MEMS research. The conference was initially founded by the inventors of MEMS, such as Kurt Petersen, who attends every single one. The acceptance rate was at 50% this year, and the conference is notoriously hard to get into. In our field, a paper at this conference is considered equivalent to a Journal publication. Invitations to submit to a special issue of J.MEMS, which is the top Journal in our field, usually follows.<br><br>
