<p>UIC is showcasing its impact on the
community during the COVID-19 pandemic with TV ads currently running on NBC5/Telemundo,
as well as digital advertisements. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95ugKMF51FA">30-second TV ad</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbc6wqGSxH4">15-second digital spot</a>
are running in English and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvTayW6t7OQ">Spanish</a>
through May 17. The ads, which began April 22, also thank UI Health frontline
workers and UIC essential workers, honor UIC’s 2020 grads, celebrate resilience
and highlight UIC’s “Best Value” ranking from the Wall Street Journal/Times
Higher Education.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>&#8220;First and
foremost, we wanted to thank everyone who is working so tirelessly to ensure
that the important work at UIC continues,” said Katie Hession, director of UIC
Marketing and Brand Management. “Secondly, we wanted students and prospective
students to know that while the world is changing, the importance of their
degree won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>The TV ads have run during TV shows
such as “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” “Saturday Night Live,” “Dateline,” “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” and
more. Digital ads appear on websites that are part of Universal/Comcast’s
digital portfolio, such as Today.com, MSNBC.com, Bravo.com and more. </p>



<p>“We
chose&nbsp;NBC/Telemundo, the only dual language
station in Chicago —under one company, Universal/Comcast, which also delivers a
vast portfolio on the digital side,” Hession said.</p>



<p>Additional radio ads are currently
airing on WBEZ and WVON.</p>

<p>Borrowing a concept from quantum mechanics, a researcher from UIC’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department is improving our ability to get crucial health information from sensors embedded in medical implants.</p>
<p>Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Associate Professor Pai-Yen Chen has greatly improved a reader that is integrated with wireless micro- and nano- sensors. He, along with Ramy El-Ganainy at Michigan Technological University, and Demetrios Christodoulides at the College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, used parity-time (PT) symmetry to increase the sensitivity and resolution of sensors used in wireless implants, resulting in far more accurate, clearer results. These implants are used in medical settings for monitoring heart failure, intraocular pressure and blood pressure, and could also have huge benefits outside of medical applications, including robotics, and radio frequency (RF) sensors in vehicles, airplanes and in other harsh environments.</p>
<p>Chen said he was attending an applied physics conference listening to a lecture on PT symmetry when he realized they could use the approach in an RF circuit.</p>
<p>“We don’t change the whole system or the sensor itself, but the way we read the results by means of wireless interrogation. It’s a very different approach,” said Chen. “Any small change in the microsensor’s electrical impedance due to, for example, physical forces can cause a large shift of resonant frequency seen in spectra of backscattered RF signals. Such results imply that sensitivity and resolvability of microsensors can be boosted.”</p>
<p>Chen is currently working with the UIC College of Medicine on a prototype of a PT symmetric wireless intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor, with hopes of potential commercialization. Eye pressure is the only known sign of glaucoma, which affects about three million Americans and is a leading cause of blindness.</p>
<p>Chen’s research group focuses on conducting theoretical modeling of light-matter interactions and radiation at the micro- and nano- scale, as well as exploring new physical phenomena and applications in the fields of nonlinear optics, optical sensing, photodetection, and energy harvesting. Chen is the recipient of several awards, including: NSF CAREER Award, ACES (Applied and Computational Electromagnetics Society) Early Career Award, SPIE Rising Researcher Award, IEEE Sensors Council Young Professional Award, IEEE Raj Mittra Travel Grant (RMTG) Award, Young Scientist Awards from URSI General Assembly and URSI Commission B: Electromagnetics, DoD and DoE fellowships.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Elena Zheleva aims to help algorithms gain insight into causality ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Elena-Zheleva-157x180-1.jpg" alt="Elena Zheleva" class="wp-image-93908"/><figcaption>Elena Zheleva</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>By Andrea Poet</strong></p>
<p>Even if we don’t realize it, machine-learning algorithms affect many of our everyday decisions: they can make recommendations on what to buy, what news to read, or whom to date. These algorithms do what they do by examining our previous choices and the choices of people who are similar to us. What they do not typically consider is the downstream impact of these recommendations: how we feel or how our perspectives change as a result.</p>
<p>It’s a missing piece that concerns Elena Zheleva, assistant professor of computer science. She hopes to resolve the problem by infusing “causal inference” into how algorithms are designed.</p>
<p>Zheleva offered an example of a Twitter post containing fringe political content. “An algorithm doesn’t consider how this tweet that is recommended to you will impact your life,” she said. “Would it enhance your life in some way, or would it contribute to radicalizing you?”</p>
<p>Gaining insight into causality — how different recommendations or interventions can help or harm us — is what Zheleva hopes to infuse into machine-learning algorithms, helping to reshape how they work.</p>
<p>“Machine-learning algorithms are used to impact many decisions in our life. That’s something [that] recommendation algorithms control, and we should be aware of the impact,” Zheleva said — especially whether the effect is negative or positive.</p>
<p>There is little research on how algorithms can maximize positive impact based on data collected in online settings, especially in rapidly changing environments. Zheleva has received grants to investigate solutions to this problem: one from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and another from Anthem.</p>
<p>The DARPA grant, which is in collaboration with the University of Southern California, isn’t solely about how algorithms affect the way people feel or what they perceive, but rather how algorithms can influence how people perform. She is studying human performance in several venues: online games, language-learning applications, and Stack Exchange, a network of question-and-answer websites where users vote on the questions and answers posted by others, leading the most highly endorsed posts to rise in reputation.</p>
<p>Zheleva’s algorithms will detect and analyze changes in a user’s performance and use that analysis to suggest tailored ways to improve attention and motivation. Her algorithm accounts for factors such as a user’s experience with a platform, the length of the user’s current session, and decisions that users make within sessions or games.</p>
<p>“We are looking different game characteristics that could affect team success,” Zheleva said.</p>
<p>For instance, if a user’s character gains or loses power in an online game, that may make some players become more fiercely competitive but cause others to lose interest and disengage. An algorithm that can keep a user engaged by recognizing and accommodating that person’s strengths and weaknesses could lead to a more successful outcome—depending on how you look at it, for the user, the platform, or both.</p>
<p>Zheleva’s other research project, funded by Anthem, is a collaboration with Houshang Darabi, an associate professor in UIC’s mechanical and industrial engineering department. In this study, Zheleva is analyzing large-scale longitudinal patient data to figure out which personalized interventions can optimize health outcomes.</p>
<p>For instance, if a person quits or cuts down on smoking, that can lead to a significant decrease in medical costs. Individuals’ attributes, such as their genetics, environment, and pre-existing conditions, can amplify or diminish the causal effects of their smoking. Zheleva’s work will use causal inference methods to predict what the outcome would have been if a person who received treatment had received a different medical intervention instead.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<p>Since March 30, UIC faculty members have shifted their in-person courses to remote learning due to COVID-19. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what the experience has been like for a few of UIC&#8217;s faculty members: </p>



<h4><strong>Virginia Reising, UIC Nursing</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-305x406.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93915" width="229" height="305" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-305x406.jpg 305w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-194x258.jpg 194w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-500x667.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-1000x1333.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-1320x1760.jpg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Virginia-Reising-teaching-at-home-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px" /><figcaption>Virginia Reising</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Prior to COVID-19, my class was hosted weekly in person. We have had to move our in-person classes online while still maintaining open discussion and case study as methods of learning. Utilizing the Zoom breakout rooms has been really helpful in letting students engage with each other in small groups.&nbsp;<br>The clinical portion of the course has moved online as well, and while I have tried to create learning experiences that mimic those the students would have had in person, it will, of course, be a different learning experience. To supplement their learning, we have created opportunities for them to simulate being with patients by hosting online simulation with actors serving in the role of patient. This allows the students to continue practicing their therapeutic communication and assessment skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>I have been so impressed with the student&#8217;s commitment to continued learning during what is a stressful and intense time for all. Students continue to show up to the online class time on time, prepared and ready to engage. This model of learning forces students to take ownership of the learning experience.&nbsp;<br>We start each session with a general check-in and students are given a chance to share how things are going in their lives. I have been surprised by how eager some students are to share their successes and challenges. These online sessions remind me that while we are physically distanced, the need for social connection has not disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>I have had to re-invent myself as a teacher, re-casting into a different mold. I have spent three decades working on being effective face-to-face, but online is different.&nbsp;I have been working hard to provide the same interactive peer-instruction practices that many students find useful.&nbsp;I still use clickers, but they are web clickers.&nbsp;I still have groups of three or four students briefly talk in small groups, but they are now all separate Google Meet groups.&nbsp;I still have students collaborate and compare answers with other groups, but now the comparison takes place online in a shared Google Slides document that the whole class edits together, with each small group having their own page where they collaborate on questions, answers and show their work.<br>Knowing how tiring it can be to listen to poor audio and watch grainy video, I&#8217;ve invested in a headset mic, a nicer webcam and lights to minimize poor communication due to equipment issues. Office hours are online.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going? </strong><br>OK, though it greatly increases the burden on students to be active in their engagement with learning. In class, there is social pressure to participate, but at home with the webcam off, each student needs to work harder to get the same level of engagement. Staring at a screen all day and listening to compressed audio online is fatiguing, both for me and for my students.</p>

<h4><strong>Anthony Felder, Bioengineering </strong></h4>



<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Some classes are easier to move online than others, but in general, I’ve tried to maintain consistency and rigor as I would with a traditional semester. I hope this helps us to focus and take our minds off of the ongoing pandemic. Notably though, all of my lectures are still given live, but now recorded and through BB collaborate.&nbsp;For teaming classes, we’ve migrated all communications to webconference software to help ensure we still work together cohesively.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>Remote classes are a challenge in many ways.&nbsp;I think focusing is hard when you use your home for&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;(work, school, relaxation, eating, sleeping) and that’s a challenge for us all. These remote classes also make it hard for me to read the room — I’m delivering technical content to a blank screen with no faces and feedback is minimal.&nbsp;However, I am consistently surprised by the tenacity and adaptability of our students to the pandemic — their grit and dedication is really inspiring!&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>John Coumbe-Lilley, Applied Health Sciences</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-541x406.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-93917" width="406" height="305" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-541x406.jpg 541w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-344x258.jpg 344w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-768x576.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-500x375.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-1000x750.jpg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/John-Coumbe-Lilley-teaching-at-home-1320x990.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 406px) 100vw, 406px" /><figcaption>John Coumbe-Lilley</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to move your courses online?</strong><br>Since I completed the Illinois Online Network certificate program at our sister school in Springfield in 2012, I have developed courses since then to move from face to face to online in short order. I am fortunate I had great training and have been teaching online, hybrid and face-to-face courses regularly. Recently, I needed to learn how to make better instructional videos, learn new software, use different technologies and make sure I over-communicated with my students. My teaching network expanded to include colleagues outside UIC who make human resources and training and education videos for corporate clients.&nbsp;I have been able to share what I learned with my colleagues because of our department’s commitment to teaching.</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>I feel satisfied with how things are going; I think students have shown remarkable resilience and adapted well in spite of barriers like access, hardware and bandwidth issues. I observed many colleagues make huge strides in a short time, often working 12-18 hour days to learn, adapt and implement remote learning.&nbsp;I feel given we are essentially providing emergency remote learning, we are doing very well. No doubt things have been difficult for some more than others, but nobody can doubt the commitment of UIC educators, administrators and most importantly students to making the best of a special situation nobody asked for.</p>

<p><strong>What adjustments have you made to your courses to move them online</strong>?<br>Weekly lectures have been “live” via Zoom with use of narrated Powerpoints as needed.&nbsp;Emails to and from students have been plentiful. Additional “group” projects that were supposed to be presented live are now being displayed via Blackboard Discussion Board posting, almost like a blog, to promote student engagement. Exams have been given remotely using Examsoft software, which thankfully was in place earlier in the semester!</p>



<p><strong>How are the remote courses going?</strong><br>In general, students and faculty have been flexible, which has been key to success.&nbsp;I miss seeing my students in lecture live; however, given the unprecedented times, I think we are doing the best we can! I have made sure to streamline assignments and students have appreciated extensions and flexibility on due dates!</p>

<p>While growing up in Damascus, Syria, Anis Barmada faced
challenges that could derail the most positive person.&nbsp; </p>



<p>To cope with the loss of his father at age 6 and contend
with the danger of a civil war, he remained strong in mind and spirit with the
help of his mother and brother. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015, he was well-served by his confident determination upon immigrating to the U.S., where he had to quickly adjust to a new culture, become fluent in English and begin his senior year at Wheeling High School.</p>



<p>Educational goals and opportunities
to improve the quality of life for himself and others have been consistent
motivating forces for Barmada from Syria to UIC, where he has been an Honors
College member and will earn degrees in biological sciences and chemistry from
the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.</p>



<p>In April, he was one of 49 international students selected
for the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship for graduate studies at the
University of Cambridge.</p>



<p>Barmada earned the honor through a highly competitive
selection process, which emphasizes outstanding academic achievement and social
leadership. The newly elected international cohort joins more than two dozen
scholars from the U.S., who were announced in February, to complete the Gates
Cambridge class of 2020.</p>



<p>The prestigious scholarship, which aims to build a global
network of future leaders committed to improving the lives of others, is funded
by the Gates Cambridge Trust established by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation.</p>



<p>He will pursue a master’s degree in genomic medicine in the
department of medical genetics in the School of Clinical Medicine at Cambridge.</p>



<p>“I hope to visualize the molecular, analytical, statistical,
social and clinical challenges facing the use of omics-based personalized
medicine across everyday clinics,” he said. “Professionally, I intend to pursue
an MD/Ph.D. advancing biochemical and computational technologies to address
currently incurable diseases and contributing to the crafting of a new era of
health care without disparities.”</p>



<p>Barmada, who is minoring in mathematics, is part of the
President’s Award Program STEM Initiative at UIC, which is a selective peer and
faculty network for students in STEM disciplines to do research, develop professional
connections and prepare for graduate education.</p>



<p>Since his first year at UIC, he has conducted research on
diabetic eye disease in the laboratory of Scott Shippy, UIC associate professor
of chemistry and bioengineering, while also volunteering at an ophthalmology
clinic that serves patients of the same life-changing, blindness-causing
disease conditions.</p>



<p>“Through these experiences, I found an articulation of my
interests in patient-driven research that considers both the biochemical and
socioeconomic lenses,” he said.</p>



<p>Shippy considers Barmada “nothing short of remarkable” and,
as an example, noted his key role in the lab’s project to collect tears from
mice to look for markers of disease that resulted in two first-author
publications from the young researcher.</p>



<p>“He has grown tremendously from those first days learning
the basic lab techniques to the present day with a research-oriented opinion
article under review in an ophthalmology journal,” Shippy said. “With his
intellect and astounding work ethic, I predict he will have a large impact on
the future of health care as a scientist-physician.”</p>



<p>The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is the latest honor for
Barmada, who earned a prestigious Goldwater scholarship in 2019 and was among
the U.S. finalists for a 2020 Rhodes Scholarship.</p>



<p>He is the recipient of several scholarships and awards, in
addition to research support via Honors College research grants, the Liberal
Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative and the chemistry
department’s Herbert E. Paaren Summer Research Stipend.</p>



<p>Barmada, a resident of Mount Prospect, is the fifth UIC
student to win a Gates Cambridge Scholarship since the program was established
through a $210 million donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in
2000.</p>



<p>He credits his life and educational experiences for shaping
his work ethic, skills to adapt and positive thinking.</p>



<p>“Finding order in my disordered life experiences gave me
precious lessons that schools cannot teach,” said Barmada in a 2019 interview
with UIC Today. “What keeps me motivated in my research is that although I do
not know if there is a cure for every disease, I know we simply must work hard
to find it.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Student finds success as first author on sustainability research]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-290x406.jpeg" alt="Joe Bozeman III" class="wp-image-93830" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-290x406.jpeg 290w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-184x258.jpeg 184w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-768x1076.jpeg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-1097x1536.jpeg 1097w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-1462x2048.jpeg 1462w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-500x700.jpeg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-1000x1401.jpeg 1000w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-1320x1849.jpeg 1320w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Joe-Bozeman-scaled.jpeg 1828w" sizes="(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px" /><figcaption>Joe Bozeman III</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Before he had
even defended his thesis, Joe Bozeman III already was first author on published
research studies, interviewed by national publications and an invited speaker
at events such as the Field Museum’s “Night of Ideas.”</p>



<p>“Some of the
successes came immediately after we began to publish,” said Bozeman, a doctoral
student in civil engineering. “I was surprised and taken aback, quite frankly,
and it’s been flowing ever since.” </p>



<p>Bozeman was
given the opportunity to become first author on his research by his adviser,
Thomas Thies, director of the UIC Institute for Environmental Science and
Policy. </p>



<p>“I have to give
credit to my adviser when it comes to being able to be the face of my own
research, because he could have taken the mantle and facilitated a lot of the
research, but he’s allowed me to represent the research as the first author on
all the publications,” Bozeman said. </p>



<p>Bozeman’s research studies on topics related to energy and environmental sustainability have been featured in major scientific magazines such as Popular Science, in newspapers such as the New York Post, and on NPR.</p>



<p><a href="https://today.uic.edu/white-peoples-eating-habits-produce-most-greenhouse-gases">One study</a>, published in March 2019 in the Journal
of Industrial Ecology, found that white Americans disproportionately affect the environment by eating foods
that require more water and release more greenhouse gases compared with foods that
black and Latino individuals eat. <a href="https://today.uic.edu/diets-of-latinos-and-blacks-have-greatest-environmental-impact-per-dollar-spent">Another study</a>, published in June 2019 in Environmental
Engineering Science, found that despite spending less than white households on food overall,
black and Latino households have more impact on the environment per dollar
spent on food than white households.</p>



<p>“I look at issues of food consumption and socioeconomic and racial groups and how they affect the environment,” Bozeman said. “I pay attention to those differences and come up with public policy proposals that could help alleviate some of those issues. The implications of the research are wide-ranging.</p>



<p>“From a public
policy perspective, we can start shaping our behavioral initiatives and changes
around this kind of information so that we can be more targeted and effective
in our public policy development.”</p>



<p>He faced some criticism on social media for the racial component of his research, which was peer-reviewed and “solid in terms of statistical significance,” he said. </p>



<p>“Race is
central to my research. As an African American male, I didn’t anticipate some
of the backlash I would receive going down this research path,” he said. “UIC
and a host of the academic world really came to back me up when I needed it the
most. That helped to alleviate some of the attacks that were coming — and
unfounded.”</p>



<p>His love of
Captain Planet as a child sparked his initial interest in sustainability, but he
became formally engaged in the field during President Obama’s 2008 campaign,
when issues of climate change, energy and sustainability became dominant domestic policy concerns for voters. </p>



<p>“I wanted to be
part of that,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2010,
Bozeman has worked with the Department of Veteran Affairs. He currently works
with the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care
Center in North Chicago, overseeing
environmental compliance and energy conservation programming.</p>



<p>“It’s been a really
great experience,” he said. “I’ve been able to apply my research and develop
leadership skills.” </p>



<p>Before joining
UIC, Bozeman played Division I basketball at Wright State University, where he
completed his undergraduate and master’s degrees. </p>



<p>Since defending
his dissertation, Bozeman has been interviewing for assistant professor
positions and spending time with his wife, Rayne, who is an assistant professor
of psychology at Chicago State University, and his daughter, Dionne, who is 12.</p>



<p>“My wife definitely keeps me on my toes when it comes to my research,” he said. “My daughter is really interested in marine biology so she’s already thinking about college. I’m sure she’s influenced by her parents. I’m very excited about our future.”</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Inspired to purse career by nurses who showed compassion as her newborn faced medical challenges ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="pf-content">
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V-271x406.jpg" alt="Jessica Lechuga" class="wp-image-93947" srcset="https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V-271x406.jpg 271w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V-172x258.jpg 172w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V-500x750.jpg 500w, https://today.uic.edu/files/2020/04/Jessica-Lechuga_V.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px" /><figcaption>Jessica Lechuga and her daughter, Abby</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jessica Lechuga was just 17 years old when she gave birth to her daughter, Abby, who had a rare and serious medical condition called CHARGE syndrome, a disorder that affects many areas of the body. Being a young mom, Lechuga felt intimidated by the unfamiliar terminology her doctors used to describe her daughter’s condition, but her nurses in the neonatal unit helped her feel confident that she could care for her newborn. </p>



<p>“Nurses in the neonatal unit are heroes,” she said. “They really make
you feel like you’re part of your child’s health journey.”</p>



<p>It was their compassion that inspired Lechuga to eventually pursue her
own career in nursing. </p>



<p>“The nurses really helped me just continue to get stronger as a mother
and just persevere. They gave me a lot of strength to be able to handle
everything that was going on,” said Lechuga, who graduates this May with her
bachelor’s in nursing.</p>



<p>A single mom, Lechuga put college on hold for a
decade after her daughter was born. She worked as a pharmacy technician and
focused on caring for Abby, who needed multiple surgeries before age 3. When
Abby’s health stabilized around 10 years old, Lechuga felt confident that she
could go to college and pursue her dreams. She took her prerequisites at a community
college before joining UIC’s bachelor of science in nursing program in 2018.</p>



<p>“I was very hesitant about going to school after so many years because I didn’t want to be the ‘older student.’ But here at UIC, I never felt that way,” she said. “There’s actually a big range of ages and that made me feel really comfortable. In the end, I know I will be providing a better and brighter future for my daughter.”</p>



<p>UIC was a perfect fit for Lechuga, with Abby’s
school located right next door. Now 14, Abby is doing well — the only health
issue that remains is bilateral hearing loss — and she enjoys spending time in
a college environment. </p>



<p>“Abby works on her homework in the College of
Nursing lobby and people in the college know her and say hi to her,” Lechuga
said. “She’s thriving.” </p>



<p>Lechuga, a first-generation college student, found
her UIC experience to be challenging, yet rewarding. </p>



<p>“I knew nursing school was going to be one of the hardest things I’ve
ever done in my life,” she said. “It was challenging, but it was definitely
doable. My experience at UIC has been great and I love the diversity of the
student body. I will miss having that little window into so many different
worlds.”</p>



<p>Although her introduction to nursing took place in a neonatal unit,
Lechuga plans to spend her career at the other end of the spectrum — in a
geriatric primary care setting. </p>



<p>“Being in the neonatal room is definitely triggering for me; there’s
still a lot of PTSD from that for me, listening to the beeps,” she said. “So, I
knew that wasn’t the route for me. </p>



<p>“Working in a pharmacy, my population was geriatrics for the most
part, so I have a lot of experience of how to relate to them and interact with
them. And in my culture — I’m Mexican American — we really value our elders.
They are the ones who help our family. They’re the ones you go to when you need
advice. I knew this was the population I want to serve. It’s a thank you to
them.” </p>



<p>As Lechuga finishes up her studies, she’s excited to join the
workforce, especially at such a critical time. </p>



<p>“I am so proud of the&nbsp;nursing&nbsp;profession&#8217;s
response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “I signed up to care for people
in need, and now more than ever, there are many in need. I am ready.”</p>



<p>Lechuga and her daughter will both be celebrating graduations together
this May, as Abby completes eighth grade. </p>



<p>“I plan on throwing a mini, double celebration,” Lechuga said. “We will probably throw a Zoom session with our loved ones and indulge in well-deserved sweets.”</p>
